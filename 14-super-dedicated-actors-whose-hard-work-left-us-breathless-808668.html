The final result is&nbsp;the joint effort of&nbsp;the cast and crew, but the actors are the ones who make it&nbsp;all believable thanks to&nbsp;their skill, dedication, and bravery.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> brings you a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;14&nbsp;actors who went above and beyond to&nbsp;create movie characters that left audiences mesmerized.</p><p><h2>1. Kate Winslet</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1be/ffc/bdcae55060af1beb71d9ce2fe1.jpg><p>Legendary <a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> actress <a href=# title="Kate Winslet" data-link=tag>Kate Winslet</a> is&nbsp;known for memorable movie transformations, but this time she surprised everyone with her incredible abilities. While filming James Cameron’s <i>Avatar&nbsp;2</i>, Winslet broke the on-film breath-hold record. She managed to&nbsp;hold her breath for 7.14&nbsp;minutes, longer than <a href=# title="Tom Cruise" data-link=tag>Tom Cruise</a>’s 6-minute breath hold in&nbsp;<i>Mission: Impossible.</i></p><p>The actress<i> </i><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>described</a> the experience as ’’wonderful," explaining, ’’I had to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;free-dive to&nbsp;play that role in&nbsp;<i>Avatar</i>, and that was just incredible. My&nbsp;longest breath hold was 7&nbsp;minutes and 14&nbsp;seconds, like crazy, crazy stuff." The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>continued</a>, “Your mind completely drifts off. You can’t think about anything, you can’t make lists in&nbsp;your head, you’re just looking at&nbsp;the bubbles underneath you.”</p><p><h2>2. Benedict Cumberbatch</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fc/922/20dea055f78492b86397529361.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the 2014&nbsp;movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The</i> <i>Imitation Game</i></a>,<i> </i>Cumberbatch was so&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;portray the legendary cryptanalyst, Alan Turing, accurately and realistically that he&nbsp;wore a&nbsp;copy of&nbsp;Turing’s 60-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dentures</a> throughout filming. Playing a&nbsp;tragic genius was a&nbsp;challenge in&nbsp;itself, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, ’’Turing got under my&nbsp;skin. <strong>It&nbsp;was just so&nbsp;pitiful. Imagining the physical weakness, the vulnerability, the exhaustion</strong>, how the hormones affected his emotional state... It&nbsp;was all ungovernable.’’<br></p><p><h2>3. Natalie Portman</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7fd/a78/f09dfe5191bb47bc1d07657ed7.jpg><p>Many fans were wondering if&nbsp;<a href=# title="Natalie Portman" data-link=tag>Natalie Portman</a>’s arms were real in&nbsp;the movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Thor: Love and Thunder</i></a>. And the answer is&nbsp;yes. But looking like a&nbsp;professional bodybuilder took some time and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;effort. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actress</a> spent 10&nbsp;months bulking up&nbsp;and working out every day. Her routine also included <strong>weightlifting and boxing,</strong> and since her workouts were so&nbsp;rigorous, Portman, who is&nbsp;a&nbsp;vegan, had to&nbsp;adjust her diet so&nbsp;she could ensure enough protein intake to&nbsp;gain muscle.</p><p><h2>4. Emma Stone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/378/138/681de85145810c6dd2290c6dc8.jpg><p>The Oscar-winning actress was so&nbsp;dedicated to&nbsp;playing her role in&nbsp;the historical movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The</i> <i>Favourite</i></a>, that she was ready to&nbsp;deal with pain as&nbsp;well. <a href=# title="Emma Stone" data-link=tag>Emma Stone</a> said all her <strong>’’organs shifted’’ </strong>after wearing a&nbsp;very tight corset for days on&nbsp;end for this role. ’’Women existed like that for such a&nbsp;long time, which gives you a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;sympathy for that time period and what they were going through. <strong>For the first month, I&nbsp;couldn’t breathe</strong>," Stone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>5. Forest Whitaker</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f93/f72/e93ec652c1bb6e7c43313e23ac.jpg><p>Forest Whitaker’s performance in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Last King of&nbsp;Scotland</i></a> really showcases what it&nbsp;means to&nbsp;truly immerse yourself in&nbsp;a&nbsp;character. Not only did the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actor</a> gain an&nbsp;astonishing 30&nbsp;pounds for the role, but he&nbsp;also <strong>learned to&nbsp;speak Swahili and play the accordion</strong>. The actor’s personality also changed, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;threw himself so&nbsp;deep into the role of&nbsp;a&nbsp;controversial Ugandan leader that even his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>family</a> <strong>refused to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;him</strong> during filming. Whitaker’s work was rewarded with an&nbsp;Oscar.</p><p><h2>6. Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c88/a1d/34f5655219a21e698befd690c5.jpg><p>To&nbsp;portray a&nbsp;struggling married couple in&nbsp;the 2010 romance drama, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Blue Valentine</i></a>, Michelle Williams, <a href=# title="Ryan Gosling" data-link=tag>Ryan Gosling</a>, and their on-screen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>daughter</a> lived together for one month before <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>filming</a> started. They wanted to&nbsp;experience and explore the everyday struggles of&nbsp;a<strong>&nbsp;low-income couple in&nbsp;a&nbsp;marriage crisis</strong>, so&nbsp;they went all&nbsp;in. They lived in&nbsp;their character’s house, washed dishes 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;day, shared a&nbsp;bathroom, and did laundry together. The co-stars even stuck to&nbsp;a&nbsp;strict <strong>food budget</strong> that was based on&nbsp;their characters’ humble salaries.</p><p>Gosling <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that they even celebrated fake Christmas, bought birthday presents, baked birthday cakes, and did everything they could do&nbsp;to&nbsp;make real memories: ’’So when it&nbsp;came time to&nbsp;shoot the last part of&nbsp;the film, we&nbsp;were drawing on&nbsp;those moments."</p><p><h2>7. Jamie Foxx</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/212/bc7/9c9e3654cfb5f5f90c509514c8.jpg><p>East News<span>, </span>East News</p><p>Not only did the actor lose 30&nbsp;pounds for the leading role in&nbsp;the 2004 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>movie</a> about Ray Charles’ life, but he&nbsp;also wore prosthetic eyelids in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;realistically depict the musician’s blindness. Foxx reportedly <strong>suffered panic attacks caused by&nbsp;the prosthetics </strong>during the first 2&nbsp;weeks of&nbsp;filming. ’’Imagine having your eyes glued shut for 14&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day. That’s your jail sentence," he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. But all of&nbsp;his hard work was later rewarded when Foxx won an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oscar </a>for his performance.</p><p><h2>8. Charlize Theron</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0e9/eb6/68943059698d14c8311950effd.jpg><p>Watching <a href=# title="Charlize Theron" data-link=tag>Charlize Theron</a><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> train</a> for her role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;spy in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Atomic Blonde</i></a><i> </i>will leave you equally stunned as&nbsp;watching her in&nbsp;the movie. She is&nbsp;fighting like a&nbsp;pro, effortlessly tossing the male stunt crew members around as&nbsp;if&nbsp;they were rag dolls. But it’s thanks to&nbsp;some very rigorous training that Theron was able to&nbsp;achieve this. The actress threw herself so&nbsp;deep into the training that she twisted her knee, bruised her ribs, and <strong>clenched down on&nbsp;her jaw so&nbsp;hard she broke her teeth</strong>. ’’It was really intense,’’ Theron <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>.</p><p>Her ability to&nbsp;transform impressed&nbsp;us numerous times&nbsp;— we&nbsp;all remember her Oscar-winning performance in&nbsp;the 2003&nbsp;movie,<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i> Monster</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><h2>9. Ed&nbsp;Harris</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c87/146/e30ee35c28b78dfd378dbaebdf.jpg><p>For his role as&nbsp;the famous American painter in&nbsp;the movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Pollock</i></a><i>,</i> Ed&nbsp;Harris not only took art lessons and learned how to&nbsp;paint, but he&nbsp;also <strong>built his own art studio where he&nbsp;spent days making artwork</strong>. To&nbsp;get into character, Harris paid a&nbsp;visit to&nbsp;Jackson Pollock’s old home and spent a&nbsp;night in&nbsp;the artist’s bed to&nbsp;get the feel of&nbsp;the character.</p><p><h2>10. Leonardo DiCaprio</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a4f/781/16e7b65ac99668dba5225d455c.jpg><p>While filming Quentin Tarantino’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Django Unchained</i></a>, in&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the famous scenes, <a href=# title="Leo DiCaprio" data-link=tag>Leo DiCaprio</a> slammed his hand so&nbsp;hard on&nbsp;the table that he&nbsp;broke a&nbsp;glass and seriously <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cut</a> himself. But to&nbsp;everyone’s surprise, he&nbsp;didn’t take a&nbsp;break. The actor just ignored the wound and stayed in&nbsp;character. The scene continued, and<strong> the blood we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;the screen is&nbsp;really his.</strong></p><p>But the reward for his acting efforts came sometime later, with the movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Revenant</i></a>. For his role in&nbsp;this film, DiCaprio slept in&nbsp;<strong>animal carcasses</strong> and ate <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raw meat</a>. His effort paid off, and DiCaprio finally won his first Academy Award.</p><p><h2>11. Jared Leto</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/562/256/4c8e2655ecace2447dbf096f4d.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jared Leto" data-link=tag>Jared Leto</a> is&nbsp;known for taking <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>method</a> acting to&nbsp;the extreme. He&nbsp;rarely breaks character throughout the duration of&nbsp;filming, and working on&nbsp;2022 <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Morbius</i></a> was no&nbsp;different. Similar to&nbsp;the character he&nbsp;plays in&nbsp;the movie, Leto <strong>used crutches on&nbsp;set to&nbsp;reflect his character’s physical features</strong>. He&nbsp;even used them on&nbsp;his bathroom breaks, but ultimately, the director asked him to&nbsp;find an&nbsp;alternative way to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;character since it&nbsp;was making the filming process too long. In&nbsp;the end, they made a&nbsp;deal, so&nbsp;Leto used a&nbsp;wheelchair instead during filming <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>breaks</a> to&nbsp;speed up&nbsp;the process.</p><p><h2>12. Meryl Streep</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fa/c21/40f3c452bca8e849a952108d37.jpg><p>We&nbsp;all remember Streep’s iconic portrayal of&nbsp;fashion magazine editor Miranda Priestly in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Devil Wears Prada</i></a><i>. </i>To&nbsp;help her stay in&nbsp;character as&nbsp;the strict, coldhearted woman, Streep reportedly cut communication with all the cast members throughout the filming process: ’’It was horrible! I&nbsp;was miserable in&nbsp;my&nbsp;trailer. I&nbsp;could hear them all rocking and laughing,’’ she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted </a>that this acting approach made her <strong>so&nbsp;depressed that</strong> <strong>she decided to&nbsp;give it&nbsp;up&nbsp;completely</strong>.</p><p><h2>13. Jake Gyllenhaal</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a93/2f0/a44984513b8f00272b1bd28de4.jpg><p>For his role in&nbsp;the drama, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>End of&nbsp;Watch</i></a>, Jake Gyllenhaal spent 5&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>months</a> with police officers out in&nbsp;the streets of&nbsp;Los Angeles, witnessing all kinds of&nbsp;<strong>real-life crime scenes</strong>. He&nbsp;went on&nbsp;ride-alongs with the police and had to&nbsp;endure <strong>demanding fight training</strong> every day for a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months. The actor explained that the idea was ’’to stay true to&nbsp;the authenticity of&nbsp;what we&nbsp;saw, not the romantic version," and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admits</a> that making this movie ’’changed his life.’’</p><p><h2>14. Mickey Rourke</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c11/d30/485efb5e00b4d2d4a1dabd2f71.jpg><p>For his role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;villain in&nbsp;<i>Iron Man&nbsp;2</i>, Mickey Rourke visited <strong>top security prisons several times </strong>and became friends with a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;inmates to&nbsp;better understand his on-screen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>character</a>. He&nbsp;also took foreign language lessons every day for several hours to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;portray Ivan Vanko more realistically. But this was not the first time Rourke went all in&nbsp;for a&nbsp;movie role.</p><p>In&nbsp;the 2008&nbsp;movie, <i>The Wrestler</i>, Rourke performed the majority of&nbsp;his own stunts, which resulted in&nbsp;him getting injured several times. This role appealed to&nbsp;the actor so&nbsp;much that he&nbsp;extended it&nbsp;to&nbsp;real life when he&nbsp;showed up&nbsp;at&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>WrestleMania</a> XXV and <strong>knocked out a&nbsp;professional wrestler</strong>, Chris Jericho, with a&nbsp;single punch.</p><p>Have you seen any of&nbsp;the movies we&nbsp;mentioned here? Which movie role do&nbsp;you think was the most challenging to&nbsp;play?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH51edKup56qXZmypbXCmquenF2WsLW70axksKCfqLJutMCrm2avn6e4brjEn6tmraNir7OxwK2fpZ2jqHp5fJdvbXFn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
