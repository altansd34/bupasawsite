Perhaps one of the most versatile <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a> words, “coup,” can be found in more expressions than you would think. But what does it mean? Why is it used in so many ways? Can you ever hope to learn them all?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Ways-of-using-“coup”-in-French>Ways of using “coup” in French</h2><p>Let’s start off with the word “coup”. On its own, it’s just a noun used to mean “a blow, a punch, or a bang”. Though, it can be used in multiple ways. For instance, “J’ai appris la nouvelle. C’était un vrai choc !” (I heard the news. It was a real shock/blow!).</p><p>The real trouble with “coup” begins when you add on additional words, like “de main” or “de pinceau.”&nbsp;Tout à coup, it can turn into a real headache.</p><p>To help you sort out your&nbsp;coup de foudre&nbsp;from your&nbsp;coup d’oeil, here’s a list of some of the most common <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expressions</a> you’ll come across with the word “coup.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10 expressions with coup in French</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Coup de main</h3><p>If you only knew the meaning of “coup”, you might assume that&nbsp;un coup de main&nbsp;(literally, a blow with the hand) would only lead to trouble. In reality, if you wanted to “donner un coup de main”, you’d be offering someone a helping hand.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Coup d’oeil</h3><p>Striking something with your eye sounds odd, but when you think of&nbsp;un coup d’oeil&nbsp;as “a glance”, it makes sense. So, when your friend drags you into a store to “jeter un coup d’oeil”, you’ll have a much better idea of what’s going on.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Coup de foudre</h3><p>Though, foudre means a lightning strike, this expression is often used to refer to the fabled “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">love at first sight</a>.” Whether you believe in it or not, it’s a helpful expression to know if you like music or romance <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">novels</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Coup de coeur</h3><p>Similar to&nbsp;un coup de foudre,&nbsp;the meaning of un coup de coeur&nbsp;refers to something you just love. The only difference is it’s usually used with things, not people. For example, “Ce restaurant est mon autre coup de coeur!” (This restaurant is my other favourite!)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Coup du sort</h3><p>If you’ve ever been on the receiving end of some bad luck, you might say you’ve been hit by misfortune. In other words, “tu peux remercier un mauvais coup du sort.” (You can thank a bad stroke of luck).</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>6. Coup de téléphone / fil</h3><p>This expression is often used as informal way to describe a phone call. You’ll most commonly hear “un coup de fil,” but you could also say “un coup de téléphone” if you want to be a bit less <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">informal</a>.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>7. Coup de soleil</h3><p>Forget to put on sunscreen for a day at the beach? Be careful not to “attraper un coup de soleil” or get a sunburn.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>8. Boire un coup</h3><p>If your French friend invites you out to “boire un coup,” they’re asking you to come have a drink.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>9. Tout à coup</h3><p>You might encounter&nbsp;tout à coup&nbsp;in a good horror story. It means “suddenly” or “without warning.” “Tout à coup, il y a un cri fort” (Suddenly, there was a loud scream).</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>10. Du coup</h3><p>You might be surprised by how often you come across this one. The meaning of du coup is “consequently” or “thus” and you’ll find that the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French use</a> it similar to the word “donc.” For example, “Du coup, on peut manger maintenant?” (So, can we eat now?)</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Coup in French</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">These expressions</a> will give you a good head start, but there are even more to learn. The best thing to do is start practicing all the different ways you can use them in everyday speech.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you know any other expressions that use the word “coup”?</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lingoda-2020-favicon.png><h2>Cassie Wright</h2><p>Cassie Wright is a freelance writer and blogger living in the United States.
