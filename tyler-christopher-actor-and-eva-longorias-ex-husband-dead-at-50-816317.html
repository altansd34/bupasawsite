The news was confirmed by&nbsp;former <i>General Hospital</i> co-star Maurice Benard on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>. “It&nbsp;is&nbsp;with great sadness that we&nbsp;share the news of&nbsp;the passing of&nbsp;Tyler Christopher. Tyler passed away this morning following a&nbsp;cardiac event in&nbsp;his San Diego apartment,” Benard <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>announced</a>, revealing <strong>his cause of&nbsp;death</strong>.</p><p>“Tyler was a&nbsp;truly talented individual that lit up&nbsp;the screen in&nbsp;every scene he&nbsp;performed and relished bringing joy to&nbsp;his loyal fans through his acting. Tyler was a&nbsp;sweet soul and wonderful <a href=# title=friend data-link=tag>friend</a> to&nbsp;all of&nbsp;those who knew him. Tyler was an&nbsp;advocate for better mental health and substance use treatment who openly spoke about his struggles with bipolar depression and alcohol. We&nbsp;are beyond devastated by&nbsp;the loss of&nbsp;our dear friend and pray for his children and his father,” he&nbsp;added.</p><p>Christopher played Cassadine for nearly 1200 episodes over the course of&nbsp;20&nbsp;years, from 1996 to&nbsp;2016, which won him one Daytime Emmy in&nbsp;1998 and two other nominations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e5d/886/40bd495226950970d462e23d9a.jpg><p>From 2002 to&nbsp;2004, Christopher was married to&nbsp;actress Eva Longoria. The pair <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> after she first appeared in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2000 episode of&nbsp;<i>General Hospital</i>. Although any other details of&nbsp;their relationship were kept private, the couple walked out together on&nbsp;red carpets multiple times before separating.</p><p>In&nbsp;2008, Longoria spoke highly of&nbsp;her former husband and explained how the end of&nbsp;their relationship might have been her fault. “He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;lovely man, but&nbsp;I was very young,” Longoria <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “I&nbsp;didn’t know who I&nbsp;was, and&nbsp;I was still struggling as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor. I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;terrible wife.”</p><p>The late actor went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;re-marry in&nbsp;2008, to&nbsp;auto racing pit <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reporter</a> Brienne Pedigo, with whom he&nbsp;had both of&nbsp;his children, Greysun James and Bohemee. The two split in&nbsp;2021.</p><p><h2>Tributes quickly started flooding&nbsp;in.</h2></p><p>Alyssa Milano was one of&nbsp;the first celebrities to&nbsp;turn to&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> to&nbsp;pay homage to&nbsp;the late actor. Milano, well-known for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>portraying</a> Phoebe Halliwell for 8&nbsp;seasons on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Charmed</i></a>, took to&nbsp;Instagram to&nbsp;share a&nbsp;still from an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;the show which Christopher also featured&nbsp;in. “It&nbsp;feels like the world is&nbsp;caving&nbsp;in. Tyler Christopher has passed away,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>captioned</a>. “He&nbsp;was a&nbsp;wonderful actor and so&nbsp;good in&nbsp;the <i>Charmed</i> episode ’Pardon My&nbsp;Past’. I&nbsp;remember him as&nbsp;being a&nbsp;sweet, sweet, soul. May he&nbsp;rest in&nbsp;peace. My&nbsp;condolences to&nbsp;his friends and family.”</p><p>Others followed, like actor Sean Kanan, recognized for his work on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Karate Kid II</i></a>&nbsp;and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>III</i></a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cobra Kai</a>, who expressed his shock at&nbsp;the news. “Stunned to&nbsp;hear that Tyler Christopher passed away. I&nbsp;have no&nbsp;words. RIP my&nbsp;friend,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, Christopher is&nbsp;among other celebrities who passed away suddenly in&nbsp;2023. Not too long before, Matthew Perry’s death shocked the world. However, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;2022&nbsp;interview, the actor spoke about <a href=#>how he’d like to&nbsp;be&nbsp;remembered once he&nbsp;passed away</a>, and he&nbsp;made it&nbsp;clear he&nbsp;didn’t want the hit show <i>Friends</i> to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the first thing people talked about.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMG6uMSrZJygop7AtbvPoZyrZZGYwbC%2BjJqlnWWVq65uuM6nnqiqmZbAbrHXZp%2Buq5KWu6V5w56YnWWRqXp2fIxxaG9rYWx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
