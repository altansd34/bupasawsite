Both young actors were struggling to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;big in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>, and once “we&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attached</a> to&nbsp;each other, we&nbsp;weren’t able to&nbsp;let&nbsp;go.” They <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>support</a> each other publicly, and they are not afraid to&nbsp;let the whole world know.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd</h2></p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>duo</a> met on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;their first movie together, the ’<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>90s</a> rom-com <i>The Object of&nbsp;My&nbsp;Affection. </i>Their on-screen chemistry translated into real life, and they briefly dated back then. However, it&nbsp;wasn’t meant to&nbsp;be&nbsp;for the&nbsp;2, and today, they’re the perfect example of&nbsp;how a&nbsp;platonic friendship can survive decades.</p><p><h2>Busy Philipps and Michelle Williams</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Co-stars</a> on&nbsp;<i>Dawson’s Creek</i> from the early 2000s, Williams and Philipps’ friendship bloomed over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;decades. They are often each other’s plus one at&nbsp;award shows, and Busy once said about Michelle, “I&nbsp;can’t believe my&nbsp;best friend is&nbsp;40. We&nbsp;met 20&nbsp;years ago, which makes no&nbsp;sense because we’re still&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>27</a>.”</p><p><h2>Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson</h2></p><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>McConaughey</a> calls Harrelson his brother from another mother. They have worked together in&nbsp;movies many times, most notably in&nbsp;the <i>True Detective</i> series. The actors often go&nbsp;on&nbsp;what Woody calls “friendship tours,” meaning they vacation together, whether it’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>paddling</a> shirtless in&nbsp;the sun or&nbsp;just enjoying each other’s company.</p><p><h2>Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg</h2></p><p>This might sound like an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>unlikely</a> friendship, but when Snoop was a&nbsp;guest on&nbsp;Martha’s cooking show back in&nbsp;2008, the 2&nbsp;just hit it&nbsp;off. So&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that they even starred in&nbsp;their own cooking show, <i>Martha &&nbsp;Snoop’s Potluck Dinner Party</i>. According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Snoop</a>, “The magic is&nbsp;right there, and&nbsp;I always say we’re best friends.”</p><p><h2>Blake Lively and Florence Welch</h2></p><p><a href=# title="Blake Lively" data-link=tag>Blake Lively</a> and Florence Welch met after one of&nbsp;the singer’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shows</a> back in&nbsp;NY. Lively was asked if&nbsp;she wanted to&nbsp;meet Florence backstage, and like a&nbsp;genuine fan, she couldn’t hold back her excitement and said yes. They bonded over <a href=# title=pizza data-link=tag>pizza</a>, and more than a&nbsp;decade later, they’re still besties. Moreover, Welch sang at&nbsp;the couple’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wedding</a>.</p><p><h2>Kate Hudson and Liv Tyler</h2></p><p>Do&nbsp;you know that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>friend</a> from high school that turned into your lifelong support? That’s <a href=# title="Kate Hudson" data-link=tag>Kate Hudson</a> and Liv Tyler&nbsp;— although both were offspring of&nbsp;iconic artists in&nbsp;Hollywood, they went to&nbsp;high school together and never left each other’s side.</p><p><h2>Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake</h2></p><p>Back in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2003</a>, when this picture was taken, <a href=# title=Timberlake data-link=tag>Timberlake</a> and Fallon were fresh into their bromance, that’s based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;good sense of&nbsp;humor and unmatched chemistry.</p><p>Jimmy shared about Justin that: “He’s the guy who’s given me&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the best laughs I’ve ever had in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. One of&nbsp;the most talented, coolest, nicest people in&nbsp;the world. You’re one in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>million</a>.” The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;have worked together on&nbsp;many comedy sketches, often turning them into viral sensations.</p><p><h2>Jennifer Garner and Jessica Biel</h2></p><p>Jennifer Garner and Jessica Biel met on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the rom-com <i>Valentine’s Day, </i>and the 2&nbsp;just clicked. They have only good words for one another. And <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Biel</a> is&nbsp;impressed by&nbsp;how Garner manages to&nbsp;balance her work and family life, saying, “I&nbsp;feel like my&nbsp;seconds are full all day long, and then&nbsp;I look at&nbsp;your life, and&nbsp;I wonder how you do&nbsp;it.”</p><p><h2>Martin Scorsese and Robert De&nbsp;Niro</h2></p><p>Tap the arrows above to&nbsp;see what <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>40</a>+&nbsp;years of&nbsp;friendship looks like. Martin Scorsese and Robert De&nbsp;Niro first <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a> when they were teenagers, and they reconnected later while working on&nbsp;the 1973 film <i>Mean Streets.</i> Today, they can’t imagine their life without their relationship.</p><p><h2>Elton John and Ed&nbsp;Sheeran</h2></p><p>Elton John was Ed&nbsp;Sheeran’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentor</a> in&nbsp;his early career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;artist, and he&nbsp;was always willing to&nbsp;help him through anything, saying, “anytime you want to&nbsp;call&nbsp;me, anytime you need advice.” Years later, although&nbsp;Ed thought people might find it&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;believe, the duo talks on&nbsp;the phone every single day. “Whether it’s a&nbsp;half-hour chat or&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2</a>&nbsp;minutes, he&nbsp;always checks up&nbsp;on&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7be/2a0/2902a3520aa2e31be94a38b563.jpg><p>Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon have known each other for longer than <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>25</a>&nbsp;years. On-screen and in&nbsp;real life, they admire each other and both are considered important figures in&nbsp;Hollywood.</p><p>They recently reunited in&nbsp;the romantic comedy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Maybe I&nbsp;Do</i></a>, and the director they worked with said, “I&nbsp;don’t think this is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;work because <strong>they love each other so&nbsp;much.</strong> They’re so&nbsp;comfortable with each other, so&nbsp;easy. And the banter, so&nbsp;unplanned and genuine.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH5xecicpqehk2KxtrvSZq6hp12lv7DCxGapnpmcYrOztcSnm6ygmaV6qrqMoaalpKmsvLCwjJyYp2WVrba0wIxxaGpwZGx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
