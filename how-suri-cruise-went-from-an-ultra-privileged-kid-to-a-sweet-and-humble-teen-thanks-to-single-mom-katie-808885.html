This is&nbsp;mainly due to&nbsp;her mom’s clever parenting style after her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>split</a> from Tom in&nbsp;2012, where she knew how to&nbsp;keep her daughter protected from the pressure of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a> and connected to&nbsp;the real world around her.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> admires how Katie succeeded in&nbsp;raising a&nbsp;kind child who prefers volunteering and being with family instead of&nbsp;indulging in&nbsp;the excesses of&nbsp;her privileged life. Here are some of&nbsp;the things the actress did to&nbsp;make sure her daughter keeps her feet on&nbsp;the ground.</p><p><h2>She was still bottle-fed at&nbsp;3.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b8/781/cd6d085fcaa52e52515579cdab.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>pediatrician</a>, children should be&nbsp;weaned off the bottle by&nbsp;the time they are 1-year-old. And even by&nbsp;the time they are 9&nbsp;months old, they have “the physical development and mouth coordination necessary to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;drink out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sippy cup or&nbsp;a&nbsp;cup with a&nbsp;straw.” Yet, Suri was still being bottle-fed by&nbsp;her mom at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;3, which led to&nbsp;some criticism back then.</p><p><h2>No&nbsp;more designer outfits.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8db/4e8/27b3d15ea4986581233f2b41ff.jpg><p>PacificCoastNews.com/EAST NEWS</p><p>At&nbsp;just the tender age of&nbsp;3, Suri’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wardrobe</a> was already estimated at&nbsp;1&nbsp;million dollars. This little kid was arguably one of&nbsp;the most stylish kids in&nbsp;Hollywood and known for her love of&nbsp;dressing up&nbsp;in&nbsp;girly, designer outfits, handbags, and heels.</p><p>Yet it&nbsp;seems that all <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> when her parents separated and Suri moved with Katie to&nbsp;New York. It&nbsp;was reported that mama put a&nbsp;stop to&nbsp;the designer-focused outfits and was even “returning unsolicited gifts and loans from designers.”</p><p><h2>She used to&nbsp;wear makeup at&nbsp;5.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0bc/f26/06e66b5785b9ad4f9265ccb02d.jpg><p>Wagner Az, PacificCoastNews.com/EAST NEWS</p><p>Besides her elaborate and posh wardrobe, Suri also loved <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> from an&nbsp;early age. In&nbsp;fact, she was often photographed <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wearing</a> lipstick even before turning 4-years-old, she was even <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spotted</a> shopping for makeup and testing some right before her 5th birthday. However, this also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> when Suri stopped living with her dad. A&nbsp;source <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>, “All that inappropriate dress-up and makeup was down to&nbsp;Tom.”</p><p><h2>She grew up&nbsp;far from the spotlight.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/052/50a/b3827a5d06b5d1d27537373952.jpg><p>PacificCoastNews.com/EAST NEWS</p><p>Despite having 2&nbsp;Hollywood stars for parents, we&nbsp;don’t see or&nbsp;hear much about Suri in&nbsp;the media. In&nbsp;fact, we&nbsp;don’t really see the teen on&nbsp;her mom’s <a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> platform either, aside from super <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rare</a> glimpses every now and then. Katie once opened&nbsp;up, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>saying</a>, “Every parent is&nbsp;challenged by&nbsp;social media and the internet.” She added, “I&nbsp;think, for&nbsp;me, it’s just limiting the amount of&nbsp;time for myself and for my&nbsp;child.”</p><p>So&nbsp;instead, this protective mom prefers that her daughter grows up&nbsp;as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible from Hollywood, spending plenty of&nbsp;time in&nbsp;Ohio, where the actress was born, surrounded by&nbsp;her grandparents and aunts. It&nbsp;was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>reported</a> that “They are a&nbsp;close-knit family and have done everything they can to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there for her and to&nbsp;help with her upbringing.”</p><p><h2>She does volunteer work with mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0b1/f33/a2838f52e98d1ab4491fe881b5.jpg><p>Despite being born with so&nbsp;much privilege, Katie made sure Suri didn’t grow up&nbsp;disconnected from reality and raised her daughter with moral values. This meant being physically and emotionally involved in&nbsp;helping others by&nbsp;doing a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;volunteering, like going to&nbsp;Greece together and helping in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>refugee camp</a> in&nbsp;2019.</p><p>We&nbsp;imagine that the time they spend together in&nbsp;humanitarian work worldwide also allows this mother and daughter to&nbsp;build strong ties. And Katie herself <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “I&nbsp;enjoy volunteering with my&nbsp;daughter and hearing her point of&nbsp;view and listening to&nbsp;her suggestions on&nbsp;how we&nbsp;can help.”</p><p><h2>She has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;chores.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/330/8b7/12c0a2533d903807831cf0797d.jpg><p>Dylan Travis/ABACA/Abaca/East News</p><p>Growing up&nbsp;surrounded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;help and people ready to&nbsp;make her life easy for her didn’t mean that Suri could get away with being lazy and spoiled. In&nbsp;fact, Katie once revealed that they have a&nbsp;very structured schedule at&nbsp;home and that little Suri has a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;<a href=# title=chores data-link=tag>chores</a> she has to&nbsp;do&nbsp;every day.<br>The mom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noted</a>, ’’She has to&nbsp;make her bed, she has to&nbsp;take her dishes to&nbsp;the sink, she has to&nbsp;put her clothes in&nbsp;the laundry.’’</p><p><h2>She attended mass every week</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/919/347/e6cff0582397d186d95feec177.jpg><p>After being homeschooled at&nbsp;first, Suri was sent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Catholic school, which meant that she didn’t have to&nbsp;follow her dad’s footsteps in&nbsp;Scientology and attend a&nbsp;Scientology school like her older half-siblings <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had</a>. The Catholic school she went to&nbsp;had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;discipline, and this included attending <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mass</a> every Thursday.</p><p><h2>Mother and daughter quality time</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb7/e24/7f165e5618aebbe7e2fb51030e.jpg><p>DISCIULLO/bauergriffinonline.com/East News</p><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;clear by&nbsp;now that the mom-and-daughter duo always puts family first and has a&nbsp;super strong bond. And that means spending time together as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible and enjoying regular activities just like the rest of&nbsp;us. Katie <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that some of&nbsp;the things the pair spent most of&nbsp;their time doing these past few months were going over Hollywood classic movies, cooking, and making quilts on&nbsp;their sewing machine.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think Katie made the right decision by&nbsp;keeping Suri out of&nbsp;the spotlight as&nbsp;she was growing&nbsp;up?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4ysrKuhXZi%2FtrXSnmSwnZ6peqe%2BzqZkmqZdqrm1vsBmp6uhpp65prPEnWSkoZRiwbB5wGaqsJ2VqXqiusNmn66lkqGybsDEnqVmrJiWu6y%2FjK2mZquZo7StsYympqZlm5bBqrGMcWdxcGhqfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
