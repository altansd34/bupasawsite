As&nbsp;a&nbsp;benefit, that smell will have a&nbsp;calming effect, helping you sleep safe and sound. It’s even better if&nbsp;you eat&nbsp;it! Garlic contains vitamin <strong>B1</strong>&nbsp;that is&nbsp;responsible for producing <a href=# title=melatonin data-link=tag>melatonin</a>, a&nbsp;sleep hormone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e6e/699/529bec50a2b971287f2eac391a.png><p>Also, garlic has a&nbsp;power to&nbsp;fight the bad bacteria and boost your immune system. The odor we&nbsp;smell when we&nbsp;cut garlic is&nbsp;actually a&nbsp;defense mechanism of&nbsp;the garlic plant. The smell appears when the garlic’s insides get exposed to&nbsp;the air. A&nbsp;chemical called <strong>Allicin</strong> is&nbsp;responsible for that, and it’s also a&nbsp;powerful antibiotic that beats germs causing infections.</p><p>Finding a&nbsp;spider or&nbsp;some insect in&nbsp;your bed is&nbsp;not the best experience. If&nbsp;you’re afraid to&nbsp;discover one in&nbsp;your sheets, garlic is&nbsp;here to&nbsp;help you out. Its odor repels uninvited guests, as&nbsp;they can’t stand this smell&nbsp;— it’s toxic for them! This trick might be&nbsp;especially helpful for people in&nbsp;Australia who have to&nbsp;co-live with a&nbsp;whole bunch of&nbsp;insects.</p><p>On&nbsp;the downside, it’s also toxic for your pets. If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;doggy or&nbsp;kitty who comes into your room, don’t ever leave garlic when you’re not present. If&nbsp;your pets eat&nbsp;it, they might experience some quite unpleasant consequences. So, just like any other vampires, mosquitoes aren’t into garlic either.</p><p>Summer is&nbsp;coming, and garlic can actually help you make it&nbsp;less disturbing. Blend some garlic and try to&nbsp;apply this substance directly to&nbsp;your <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a>. Mosquitoes and bugs won’t enjoy your company, neither will your friends. Ok, that’s bad advice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8f8/5e3/6be28a54e7bf71406df6e031cd.png><p>We&nbsp;all get splinters sometimes, and turns out garlic can help&nbsp;us out here, too. When your splinter is&nbsp;stuck, and you can’t take it&nbsp;out, a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;garlic will serve you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural remedy. Just take one clove, cut&nbsp;it, place it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the bare skin where you got your splinter, and fix it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;band-aid. First, it&nbsp;will ease the unpleasant feelings you’ve got. Second, it’ll pull the splinter to&nbsp;the surface, and so&nbsp;you’ll take it&nbsp;out easier.</p><p>Garlic is&nbsp;a&nbsp;great ingredient when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;your hair, and it’s especially helpful if&nbsp;you experience hair loss. It’s absolutely natural for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;lose up&nbsp;to&nbsp;100 hairs a&nbsp;day. Losing a&nbsp;little bit of&nbsp;hair is&nbsp;okay, but losing too much hair might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign of&nbsp;having health conditions. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;check if&nbsp;you lose too much hair, here’s how to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it.</p><p>Make sure that your hair is&nbsp;clean, dry and untangled. Gently run your fingers through your hair and see how many hairs fell out. Up&nbsp;to&nbsp;three each time is&nbsp;okay, but if&nbsp;there are more, it’s a&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;ask garlic for help. It&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;strengthen the hair that you have, but also to&nbsp;re-grow the hair that you’ve lost. Also, it&nbsp;contains vitamin&nbsp;C which stimulates the production of&nbsp;<a href=# title=collagen data-link=tag>collagen</a>. <strong>Collagen</strong> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;protein that serves as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“glue” for your body to&nbsp;keep everything together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c2d/e47/a8a90e5b75a0c2b4a51ec23b0f.png><p>It&nbsp;helps build your <a href=# title=bones data-link=tag>bones</a>, muscles, skin, teeth, and many other things including your hair. More collagen production strengthens hair follicles and stimulates further hair growth. It&nbsp;also contributes to&nbsp;postponing hair graying. Now, don’t apply garlic directly to&nbsp;your scalp since it&nbsp;can cause some burns when applied directly to&nbsp;skin. So, you can simply add some garlic to&nbsp;your diet.</p><p>Another superpower is&nbsp;that garlic can prevent food poisoning. The most common reasons for poisoning are eating undercooked food or&nbsp;germs&nbsp;— let’s say, you didn’t wash an&nbsp;apple properly. So, make sure to&nbsp;watch out for&nbsp;it, but it’s always better to&nbsp;play it&nbsp;safe and have a&nbsp;plan B.&nbsp;Antibacterial properties garlic have sound like a&nbsp;good backup.</p><p>If&nbsp;you don’t want to&nbsp;eat plain garlic, make yourself a&nbsp;fresh salad with <a href=# title=cucumbers data-link=tag>cucumbers</a>, tomatoes, whatever else you like, and chopped garlic. To&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;that friend-repelling smell, don’t forget to&nbsp;drink enough water with a&nbsp;slice of&nbsp;<a href=# title=lemon data-link=tag>lemon</a> or&nbsp;add some lemon juice right to&nbsp;your salad. Scientists even conducted one experiment. They started with two groups of&nbsp;people. In&nbsp;the first group, people were asked to&nbsp;eat garlic every day. In&nbsp;the other group, people didn’t eat&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b25/b6d/181135513590fcc602d2818fa7.png><p>After <strong>12&nbsp;weeks </strong>they found out that people who were eating garlic had&nbsp;63% less cold symptoms than those who weren’t eating&nbsp;it. For those who still got cold symptoms in&nbsp;the group of&nbsp;garlic eaters, they only had symptoms for <strong>1.5 days</strong> on&nbsp;average, in&nbsp;comparison to&nbsp;the average of&nbsp;<strong>5&nbsp;days</strong> for those who didn’t eat&nbsp;it. Now, if&nbsp;you want your nails look better, try honey. It&nbsp;moisturizes your nails and cuticles, making them look healthy and shiny.</p><p>Mix a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;teaspoons of&nbsp;honey with a&nbsp;tiny bit of&nbsp;lemon juice. Apply the substance to&nbsp;your nails, and massage it&nbsp;into the skin. Leave it&nbsp;for 20&nbsp;minutes, and then wash off. Your cuticles will become soft, and your nails will look better than ever. If&nbsp;you broke a&nbsp;glass, simple <a href=# title=bread data-link=tag>bread</a> will help you. First, just pick up&nbsp;large pieces of&nbsp;glass. Careful there. To&nbsp;collect even the tiniest pieces, swipe the surface with a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;bread. It’ll pick up&nbsp;everything you might have missed.</p><p>Bread also saves <a href=# title=art data-link=tag>art</a>. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;clean dusty oil paintings. First, wipe off the dust from a&nbsp;painting using a&nbsp;brush. Then, take the insides of&nbsp;the bread and carefully tap the painting with it&nbsp;to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;shine again without ruining. Forget about all the mints and chewing gums if&nbsp;you want a&nbsp;fresh breath. Cut a&nbsp;slice of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cucumber, press it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the roof of&nbsp;your mouth, and leave it&nbsp;there for half a&nbsp;minute. You’ll get an&nbsp;immediate effect.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/9bd/886/23a4f25882a0c2c336281755dc.png><p>I&nbsp;know you’re probably old enough not to&nbsp;find chewing gum stuck in&nbsp;your hair, but... things happen. Get some <a href=# title="peanut butter" data-link=tag>peanut butter</a> and apply it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the chewing gum in&nbsp;the hair. Make sure that it’s fully covered from all sides. Peanut butter is&nbsp;oily, and these oils will make the gum less sticky. Let it&nbsp;sit for several minutes and then remove the gum!</p><p><a href=# title=Milk data-link=tag>Milk</a> can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;natural makeup remover. There’s lactic acid that exfoliates the skin and washes the makeup off. Milk fat will moisturize your skin. To&nbsp;use&nbsp;it, just apply some milk right on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cotton pad and gently rub the skin. Lactose-intolerant people can use various oils, like olive, grapeseed, and even sunflower oil for the same purposes. Milk will also help you to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;that itchy feeling after a&nbsp;mosquito bite. Simply apply some milk on&nbsp;the affected area. Soothing ingredients contained in&nbsp;milk will ease the itching, and you’ll feel better soon.</p><p>You can use raw potatoes to&nbsp;clean windows and mirrors. Just cut a&nbsp;slice, glide it&nbsp;over the surfaces and then wipe it&nbsp;off with a&nbsp;clean cloth. It’ll also keep the glass from fogging. You can also use potatoes to&nbsp;clean metal surfaces. Acid contained in&nbsp;potatoes perfectly deals with rust. Again, cut a&nbsp;potato and glide it&nbsp;over a&nbsp;rusty surface. Leave it&nbsp;for half an&nbsp;hour, and then wipe it&nbsp;off with a&nbsp;scrub. If&nbsp;your coffee was too hot and burned your tongue this morning, sugar can help you. Put some sugar in&nbsp;your mouth, it’ll relieve the unpleasant feelings of&nbsp;your burning tongue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/512/738/403df1598ba8eeaa43438ee783.png><p>With the help of&nbsp;olive oil and sugar, you can make a&nbsp;great scrub for your lips that will moisturize them and remove the old cells. Mix some sugar with a&nbsp;few drops of&nbsp;olive oil and apply this mixture to&nbsp;your lips. Rub gently all over your lips and wash away with lukewarm water.</p><p>Don’t throw away a&nbsp;banana peel after you’ve finished&nbsp;— it’s great for exfoliating and pore unclogging. Rub the fleshy side of&nbsp;the peel directly onto your skin. Let sit on&nbsp;the face for about 10&nbsp;minutes, and then wash the residues away with lukewarm water. A&nbsp;mashed banana works magic on&nbsp;cracked heels. Massage it&nbsp;onto the heels and let it&nbsp;sit for about 10&nbsp;minutes. Another way to&nbsp;soften your heels is&nbsp;to&nbsp;soak them in&nbsp;mouthwash. Pour enough mouthwash to&nbsp;soak your heels into a&nbsp;basin and wait about 45&nbsp;minutes, and then rinse with water. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;bonus, your heels will have a&nbsp;sweet, sweet breath.</p><p>Mouthwash can also be&nbsp;really helpful for your laundry. Add a&nbsp;small cup of&nbsp;your favorite mouthwash next time you do&nbsp;the laundry to&nbsp;sanitize&nbsp;it. It’ll help get rid of&nbsp;germs and will keep your washing machine clean. It’s great for gym clothes. If&nbsp;you pour some mouthwash onto your cleaning tool, you can also use it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;glass cleaner. It’s good for keeping the screen clean, and it&nbsp;also helps get rid of&nbsp;mold and dirt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b94/7db/aaa9d45fd4afff2051012ba547.png><p>If&nbsp;your hair is&nbsp;naturally fair, but you wanna go&nbsp;ever lighter, no&nbsp;need to&nbsp;bleach&nbsp;it. Use honey and cinnamon to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that. Honey originally has hydrogen peroxide, and cinnamon is&nbsp;great at&nbsp;activating&nbsp;it. Gel-based toothpastes can be&nbsp;used instead of&nbsp;hair gel.</p><p>Apply a&nbsp;drop of&nbsp;toothpaste on&nbsp;a&nbsp;palm, rub it&nbsp;between two palms and style your hair the way you want. Wait for the gel paste to&nbsp;dry out. The secret is&nbsp;simple: toothpaste gel and hair gel contain the same water-soluble polymers. But please, don’t brush your teeth with hair gel. You won’t be&nbsp;happy about&nbsp;it.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL22wIygmKukmZh6trrDnqlmsZ%2Bqv268yKWjqK9dZnqvtcahq2arlZp6qrKMoqtmr5%2BnuLR5xaipZrGfqnp5fZRsbm1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
