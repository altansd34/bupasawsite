My 15-year-old stepdaughter has been living with us every week for the past year and has been challenging when it comes to food. Initially, she adopted a vegan diet, which I accommodated by preparing meals without animal products. However, she quickly transitioned to a holistic diet and developed allergies to various foods."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Dive into the full story in&nbsp;our article to&nbsp;understand more.</p><p>My&nbsp;15-year-old <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stepdaughter </a>has been living with&nbsp;us every week for the past year and has been challenging when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;food. Initially, she adopted a&nbsp;vegan diet, which&nbsp;I accommodated by&nbsp;preparing meals without animal products. However, she quickly transitioned to&nbsp;a&nbsp;holistic diet and developed allergies to&nbsp;various foods.</p><p>Now, my&nbsp;stepdaughter avoids lactose and gluten. She insists on&nbsp;separating food and cookware, even discarding items from the pantry that she believes cause stomach pain. I&nbsp;suggested she eat outside or&nbsp;handle her own cooking and cleaning, which angered her. My&nbsp;husband started yelling at&nbsp;me&nbsp;because of&nbsp;this situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/474/890/fd350d52b488aa8beb37712c11.png><p>After <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>suggesting</a> my&nbsp;stepdaughter seek professional help for her eating issues, it&nbsp;was revealed that she had no&nbsp;allergies. Despite this revelation, she remained adamant about her dietary beliefs. Frustrated and reaching a&nbsp;breaking point, I&nbsp;started adding gluten and lactose to&nbsp;her meals, which she unknowingly consumed without any adverse effects. When her mother visited and praised her daughter’s improved <a href=# title=health data-link=tag>health</a> due to&nbsp;her new diet, I&nbsp;calmly pointed out that she had been eating the same food as&nbsp;the rest of&nbsp;us.</p><p>This revelation led to&nbsp;a&nbsp;confrontation, resulting in&nbsp;my&nbsp;stepdaughter and her mother leaving our home. My&nbsp;husband was upset with me&nbsp;because his daughter no&nbsp;longer wanted to&nbsp;live with&nbsp;us. In&nbsp;response, I&nbsp;made it&nbsp;clear that if&nbsp;he&nbsp;wanted his daughter to&nbsp;live with him, he&nbsp;could move out. Subsequently, they filed a&nbsp;lawsuit against&nbsp;me, but&nbsp;I stand by&nbsp;my&nbsp;actions. I&nbsp;refuse to&nbsp;cater to&nbsp;the demands of&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager with unfounded beliefs about food, especially given my&nbsp;demanding job as&nbsp;a&nbsp;nurse.</p><p>I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;I acted in&nbsp;the best interest of&nbsp;our family’s well-being and cannot afford the time or&nbsp;energy to&nbsp;comply with unrealistic expectations driven by&nbsp;unsupported dietary beliefs. Am&nbsp;I&nbsp;wrong in&nbsp;this stance?</p><p><h2>How have people online reacted?</h2></p><p>The overwhelming majority of&nbsp;users rallied behind the author, expressing anger towards the husband’s response, his failure to&nbsp;support his wife, and his apparent inability to&nbsp;address his own child’s needs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70c/0c9/b0259f57dcb14db783a5babf1d.jpg><ul><li>Your husband started yelling at&nbsp;you about&nbsp;it?

His pawning it&nbsp;off on&nbsp;you and then yelling at&nbsp;you while he&nbsp;does nothing all shows just how “supportive” he&nbsp;actually&nbsp;is. If&nbsp;her mom is&nbsp;drinking the Kool-Aid, she can send your stepdaughter batched meals that can be&nbsp;heated up&nbsp;by&nbsp;Little Miss Princess. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>eternally_feral&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>She wanted a&nbsp;separate, different menu. Your husband is&nbsp;stretching how long incompetence can be&nbsp;sexy with his inability to&nbsp;cook. Being a&nbsp;good father doesn’t make him a&nbsp;good husband. He&nbsp;doesn’t seem to&nbsp;respect you as&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner or&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professional unless his credentials exceed your own in&nbsp;the healthcare industry, he&nbsp;should pull his head out of&nbsp;the sand and listen. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Last-Butterscotch-68&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/112/903/5ffdcb54919c6d8ea943e7eb73.jpg><p>Many also agreed that there are likely unresolved <a href=# title="mental health" data-link=tag>mental health</a> issues that the girl’s parents should pay closer attention&nbsp;to.
