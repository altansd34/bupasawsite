Jessica Chastain and Octavia Spencer</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/061/f99/3bd5d95745904abb9ace636b67.jpg><p><a href=# title="Jessica Chastain" data-link=tag>Jessica Chastain</a> and Octavia Spencer have been good friends since they worked together on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Help</i></a>. Before they both agreed to&nbsp;work on&nbsp;the film, they had a&nbsp;conversation that revealed Spencer, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;black actress, would earn 5&nbsp;times less for her role compared to&nbsp;Chastain. “Octavia, we’re going to&nbsp;get you paid on&nbsp;this film,” Chastain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;she found out about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Later, Chastain fixed it&nbsp;so&nbsp;that they’d get equal pay. “In&nbsp;an&nbsp;industry that for the longest time had pitted women against each other, it’s really important for me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;company to&nbsp;create a&nbsp;space where everyone understands that, actually, we&nbsp;do&nbsp;better together,” Chastain <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>commented</a>.</p><p><h2>2. Jane Fonda and Meryl Streep</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/860/86a/671ee1578c865cc87a6f4cfcb1.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1977, while working on&nbsp;the dramatic film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Julia</i></a>, <a href=# title="Meryl Streep" data-link=tag>Meryl Streep</a> didn’t just make an&nbsp;important first step in&nbsp;her spectacular career, but she also found a&nbsp;mentor that boosted her path, and, as&nbsp;Streep <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>, “open[ed] probably more doors than&nbsp;I probably even know about.” The mentor was the iconic actress, <a href=# title="Jane Fonda" data-link=tag>Jane Fonda</a>.</p><p>“I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;nervous because all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;scenes were going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with you,” Streep <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>, addressing Fonda in&nbsp;a&nbsp;speech. The respected actress led the then-inexperienced Streep through the filmmaking process. “Look down...over there, that green tape on&nbsp;the floor, that’s you. That’s your mark,” said Streep, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>remembering</a> Fonda’s instructions. “And if&nbsp;you land on&nbsp;it, you will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the light, and you will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;the movie.”</p><p><h2>3. Adele and Beyoncé</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/35f/f51/1eda0f59c99bb785561a876786.jpg><p>Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP/East News<span>, </span>AFP/EAST NEWS</p><p>At&nbsp;the 2017&nbsp;Grammys, both Beyoncé and <a href=# title=Adele data-link=tag>Adele</a> left with some passionately desired gramophones. Beyoncé took home 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them; however, Adele stole the show, winning 5&nbsp;awards. As&nbsp;inspiring as&nbsp;it&nbsp;possibly could’ve been, Adele addressed her winner’s speech to&nbsp;Beyoncé, crediting her for her path and her latest album at&nbsp;that time.</p><p>“My&nbsp;life is&nbsp;Beyoncé, and the album to&nbsp;me, the <i>Lemonade </i>album, Beyoncé was so&nbsp;monumental and so&nbsp;well-thought-out,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> Adele. “You are our light. And the way that you make me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;friends feel, the way you make my&nbsp;black friends feel, is&nbsp;empowering, and you make them stand up&nbsp;for themselves. And I&nbsp;love you,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>added</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/848/72e/834f4b5de5886e34f1a53f8e6b.jpg><p>Genin Nicolas/ABACA/Abaca/East News<span>, </span>Gilbert Flores/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>They say that it’s hard for women to&nbsp;get along. However, as&nbsp;<a href=# title="Anne Hathaway" data-link=tag>Anne Hathaway</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> herself, the cast of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ocean’s 8</i></a>&nbsp;“just murdered that rumor.” The film garnered a&nbsp;cast of&nbsp;incredibly talented actresses who not only gifted&nbsp;us with a&nbsp;fantastic movie, but also showed true sisterhood.</p><p>It&nbsp;was the first film Hathaway had worked on&nbsp;since giving birth to&nbsp;her son. And even though she was treating her body generously after childbirth, “The weight was really slow to&nbsp;come off,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalled</a>. The actress was a&nbsp;different size than usual, however, her co-stars boosted her confidence. As&nbsp;she walked onto the set, <a href=# title="Sandra Bullock" data-link=tag>Sandra Bullock</a>, for example, would&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>go</a>, “Looking good, mama!” And <a href=# title="Cate Blanchett" data-link=tag>Cate Blanchett</a> would <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>say</a>, “Nice jeans, Hathaway!”</p><p><h2>5. Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/497/24b/bc6553571b9dbffdceb5cc9d4d.jpg><p>TIZIANA FABI/AFP/East News<span>, </span>0000436/Reporter/East News</p><p>Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander were working together on&nbsp;the film, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Seventh Son</i></a>, when some man in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position of&nbsp;power on&nbsp;set made a&nbsp;mean, rude joke about Vikander. The actress was so&nbsp;embarrassed that she “would have just laughed it&nbsp;off,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. However, Moore didn’t let it&nbsp;pass. She turned to&nbsp;the man and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “If&nbsp;you ever do&nbsp;that again, I’m walking out of&nbsp;here, and I’m not coming back.”</p><p>The incident really empowered Vikander. “It&nbsp;showed me&nbsp;that she had the power,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. It&nbsp;meant a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;her.</p><p><h2>6. Viola Davis and Taraji P. Henson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f79/dac/a3c54753ebbc671915eb265849.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2015, Viola Davis was the first Black woman to&nbsp;win Best Actress at&nbsp;the Emmys. Giving her speech, Davis paid tribute to&nbsp;several Black actresses who made a&nbsp;valuable input in&nbsp;the movie industry but who didn’t get the award themselves. Among them, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>named</a> Taraji P. Henson, who was sitting in&nbsp;the audience, and while she didn’t win herself, she gave Davis a&nbsp;standing ovation.</p><p><h2>7. Lizzo and Cardi&nbsp;B</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c4e/c3a/6e60345269b24aff2ec5fe8bce.jpg><p>Lizzo and Cardi B&nbsp;collaborated by&nbsp;releasing the single, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rumors</i></a>. Shortly after, Lizzo appeared on&nbsp;her Instagram live, sitting on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bathroom floor in&nbsp;tears. She opened up&nbsp;about being criticized on&nbsp;social media. “If&nbsp;you don’t like my&nbsp;music, cool; if&nbsp;you don’t like <i>Rumors</i>, it’s all cool, but a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people don’t like me&nbsp;because of&nbsp;the way I&nbsp;look,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> Lizzo.</p><p>Cardi B&nbsp;couldn’t stand idly by&nbsp;and publicly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>supported</a> Lizzo on&nbsp;her social media. “When you stand up&nbsp;for yourself, they claim you’re problematic and sensitive. When you don’t, they tear you apart until you’re crying like this,” said Cardi B. She wrote that despite how you look, haters will always “put their insecurities” on&nbsp;you.</p><p><h2>8. Lady Gaga and P!NK</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1cf/b7a/88148957a29e08f3e1ab8632d3.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News<span>, </span>JEAN-BAPTISTE LACROIX/AFP/East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2017, while <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>performing</a> at&nbsp;the Super Bowl, Lady Gaga started off her show on&nbsp;the stadium’s rooftop. At&nbsp;some point in&nbsp;her performance, Gaga just jumped off of&nbsp;the roof, earning the viewers’ admiration but also hate, as&nbsp;some fans thought this part of&nbsp;the performance resembled one of&nbsp;the shows of&nbsp;another female singer, P!NK.</p><p>P!NK herself, however, was not happy about the hate and disrespect Lady Gaga got. “Let’s squash this before it&nbsp;even has a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;thing: Lady Gaga killed it&nbsp;yesterday,” P!NK <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;her Instagram. “Let’s celebrate the woman who has the guts to&nbsp;jump off the roof and stand there in&nbsp;the first place.” P!NK went&nbsp;on, joking, “Who cares if&nbsp;I flew first? Cause I&nbsp;didn’t! Cirque and Peter Pan have been in&nbsp;the air for years!”</p><p>Whose story was the most inspiring to&nbsp;you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIVuw86mnKdlp528brzRqK2enF2ptaLAjLCcq51dqMGzu82gnKtlp52yr3nWnmSloZapeqatwqFkqKyYmr9uwc9mb2lxYWqBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
