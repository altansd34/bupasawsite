1. She makes children’s lives happier and easier.

However, we&nbsp;love her for reasons that go&nbsp;beyond her appearance and recognize her for her incredible personality.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> are in&nbsp;love with Jennifer Aniston and here are some facts that prove why she’s a&nbsp;person who deserves to&nbsp;be&nbsp;famous.</p><p><h2>1. She makes children’s lives happier and easier.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6bd/5a1/33efc15c8491371c1823533aad.jpg><p>For more than a&nbsp;<a href=#>decade</a> now, Jennifer Aniston has visited St. Jude Children’s Hospital to&nbsp;help kids who are sick with <a href=# title=cancer data-link=tag>cancer</a>. She even keeps in&nbsp;touch with the families she meets there. Children love and wait for her, not because she’s a&nbsp;celebrity, but because she has a&nbsp;<a href=# title=generous data-link=tag>generous</a> personality.</p><p>Aniston <a href=#>says</a> that she started doing everything she could because they’re little heroes. She said, “<strong>You see these little miracles walking through something </strong>that no&nbsp;child should ever have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;walking through.”</p><p><h2>2. She inspires people with speeches about their power.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d93/6e4/fe64d851389f15fceeab54a048.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2019, Aniston gave an&nbsp;inspirational speech that touched many hearts. She <a href=#>confessed</a> that she had never thought of&nbsp;herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;powerful person. At&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;11, she was excused from a&nbsp;dinner table because she didn’t have “<a href=#>anything</a> interesting to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;the conversation.” This situation stuck with her.</p><p>So, last year, the actress was thinking about how messages that we&nbsp;send to&nbsp;young girls influence them and explained, “How the things we&nbsp;say and do&nbsp;can either build them up&nbsp;— or&nbsp;tear them down. And make them feel like maybe their voices don’t matter.”</p><p>Aniston claims that every kid deserves a&nbsp;seat at&nbsp;the table. <strong>Girls should know that they’re seen, loved, and powerful. </strong>And “true power” is&nbsp;your voice “to&nbsp;hold people up&nbsp;and bring people together.”</p><p><h2>3. She supports many non-profit organizations.</h2></p><p>Besides working with St. Jude Children’s Hospital, Aniston is&nbsp;incredibly philanthropic and makes other people’s lives better. She’s a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the <a href=#>Stand Up</a><a href=#>&nbsp;to&nbsp;Cancer</a> campaign where she and other celebs aim to&nbsp;raise awareness about cancer.</p><p>Additionally, Aniston <strong>donated around <a href=#>$1&nbsp;million</a> to&nbsp;several racial justice charities.</strong> She’s not afraid to&nbsp;talk about brutality and racism and says that it&nbsp;will never be&nbsp;okay. We&nbsp;need to&nbsp;acknowledge it&nbsp;and educate ourselves.</p><p>Aniston’s generous heart has helped raise more than <a href=#>$58 million</a> for Haiti by&nbsp;being an&nbsp;active part of&nbsp;hope for the country. And her list of&nbsp;kind actions just goes on&nbsp;and&nbsp;on.</p><p><h2>4. She shows&nbsp;us how to&nbsp;be&nbsp;happy and never give&nbsp;up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3c8/7f6/3dac5250fb9bca319e70e94edc.jpg><p>It’s truly amazing how great Jennifer Aniston looks at&nbsp;age of&nbsp;51, but she explains that <a href=#>happiness</a> is&nbsp;the main key and it’s a&nbsp;choice. She has her own philosophy on&nbsp;life and is&nbsp;not one to&nbsp;worry or&nbsp;suffer: “It’s my&nbsp;<a href=#>way</a>; it’s what I’ve been given this round. But I&nbsp;would say&nbsp;I don’t find that any of&nbsp;my&nbsp;past has given me&nbsp;a&nbsp;reason to&nbsp;harden up&nbsp;and create a&nbsp;shell or&nbsp;a&nbsp;wall of ’no more, that’s it, I’m closed.’”</p><p>In&nbsp;regards to&nbsp;the question of&nbsp;what she’d say to&nbsp;the younger version of&nbsp;herself if&nbsp;she could go&nbsp;back in&nbsp;time, Aniston <a href=#>responds</a>: “<strong>Just wait till you’re 50. It’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;amazing</strong>.” She appreciates her age and is&nbsp;not sad that people get old. The actress just creates a&nbsp;special relaxed atmosphere around herself, and her smile and sense of&nbsp;humor make people fall in&nbsp;love with her.</p><p><h2>5. She fights for women’s rights and freedom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c68/5a8/79c0295b49b117897f89254153.jpg><p>Aniston tries to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;society that if&nbsp;you’re not a&nbsp;mother, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean that you’re less of&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman: “<strong>I&nbsp;don’t like [the <a href=#>pressure</a>] that people put on&nbsp;me, on&nbsp;women</strong>&nbsp;— that you’ve failed yourself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;female because you haven’t procreated. I&nbsp;don’t think it’s fair.” You still take care of&nbsp;pets, friends, friends’ children. And there’s nothing criminal about wearing a&nbsp;bikini at&nbsp;80&nbsp;if you want."</p><p>For Aniston, one of&nbsp;the most important things women can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;support each other. She says that we&nbsp;need more female <a href=#>screenwriters</a> because we&nbsp;need more female stories. <strong>Their stories are incredible too.</strong></p><p><h2>6. She fights against body-shaming.</h2></p><p>Aniston tries to&nbsp;<a href=#>explain</a> about women: “I’m just a&nbsp;girl...standing with hair and makeup. A&nbsp;stylist. A&nbsp;photographer. A&nbsp;lighting crew, wind machine, props, and a&nbsp;computer...asking you to&nbsp;think&nbsp;I woke up&nbsp;like this.” She is&nbsp;just the same as&nbsp;other women and it’s normal to&nbsp;gain weight and get old.</p><p>She can’t stand <a href=#>body-shaming</a>: “<strong>The objectification and scrutiny we&nbsp;put women through is&nbsp;absurd and disturbing.</strong>” The message that a&nbsp;girl is&nbsp;not beautiful just because she’s not incredibly thin is&nbsp;ridiculous," the actress shares. “It’s speculation. Each person has the right to&nbsp;gain weight without feeling guilty and physical ’imperfections’ shouldn’t be&nbsp;discussed that much.”</p><p><h2>7. She has the ability to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;there for you.</h2></p><p>The cultivation of&nbsp;friendships is&nbsp;crucial for Jennifer Aniston. To&nbsp;“be&nbsp;there for you” is&nbsp;not just a&nbsp;line from the Friends theme song&nbsp;— it’s a&nbsp;real thing. According to&nbsp;<a href=#>her</a>, <strong>if&nbsp;we&nbsp;support those beautiful women when they’re young, they’ll support you as&nbsp;you get older.</strong></p><p>One of&nbsp;the most powerful things, according to&nbsp;Aniston, is&nbsp;the fact that she was able to&nbsp;develop friendships with people over the course of&nbsp;30&nbsp;years. She has lots of&nbsp;friends who are with her through both good and bad days.</p><p><h2>8. She stays wise when relationships are over.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f9d/c67/897e2b582d906c32bae00ca449.jpg><p>Aniston <a href=#>shares</a> that when a&nbsp;relationship ends, it’s important to&nbsp;have “closure.” It&nbsp;works for romantic relationships and friendship: “<strong>You should always have a&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;clarity at&nbsp;the end </strong>and know why it&nbsp;began and why it&nbsp;ended. You need that in&nbsp;your life to&nbsp;move cleanly into your next phase.”</p><p>Not so&nbsp;long ago, she had an&nbsp;<a href=#>online</a> reunion with her ex-husband, Brad Pitt. Aniston was smiling the whole time and we&nbsp;feel happy that they managed to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;friendly atmosphere.</p><p><h2>9. She stays humble.</h2></p><p>Although <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston</a> has become one of&nbsp;Hollywood’s highest-paid actresses, she still is&nbsp;humble, doesn’t like to&nbsp;show off, and treats her fans very kindly. She doesn’t feel overwhelmed, but most of&nbsp;the time, she “<strong>genuinely <a href=#>enjoy</a><a href=#>s</a> the exchange.”</strong></p><p>It’s no&nbsp;wonder that with this kind of&nbsp;attitude, she continues to&nbsp;serve as&nbsp;a&nbsp;role model for many young girls.</p><p>What’s your favorite movie with Jennifer Aniston?
