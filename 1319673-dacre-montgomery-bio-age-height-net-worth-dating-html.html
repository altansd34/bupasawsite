This woman right here is the backbone of everything I do. She’s the brains AND the elegance. She’s the one that packs up her bags and moves around the world for me. She’s the one that wakes up in a different hotel room everyday, because she’s there supporting me. She’s the one that has to deal with me coming home (exhausted) acting like an absolute basket case. She’s the one that helps me flesh out every idea. She’s the sounding board and the intelligence. She’s the emotional support and also the person that allows me to live in the present and not take some things too seriously. So here’s a massive thank you to partners all around the world. The people that (sometimes) don’t get the recognition for just how much they do.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/04f932bd8f1b8998.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing facts about the fabulous Ezra Miller</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/eaad6e712ff809d0.jpg><h2>Dacre Montgomery net worth</h2><p class=align-left>According to wealthygorilla.com, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his net worth</a> is $1 million</p><h2>Social media</h2><p class=align-left>Dacre Montgomery Instagram account has 6.5 million followers.

But I was never a reckless kid.</li><li>I was really fat in school.</li><li>My mum didn't really let me watch TV until I was about 5 years old.</li><li>I didn't have any friends. I was bullied. I didn't play sports.</li><li>I have so much drive and passion for this industry and the creative arts, and I want other kids to have that kind of drive, and to have a fire in their belly for whatever industry that they want to get into.</li><li>I was bullied in high school, and it's interesting coming from the other side of the camera lens, finding out that all of these people that I thought were my antagonists in my life were probably just as insecure as I was at that age.</li><li>I wasn't a good kid in school. I wasn't a bad kid. I just didn't focus. My grades weren't good. I mucked around, you know, a phase everyone went through.</li><li>After Year 12, I went to Vancouver for my gap year and met an agent who told me to lose 25 kg.</li><li>My parents worked in the film industry, but they both worked behind the camera, so I like to think that I have a really good understanding of how all the parts of the puzzle come together to make a film or TV show.</li><li>I came from drama school, and it's a group of 18 people working together in every single production and splitting up the roles for three years, so I am very much about the team.</li><li>It's not just the actor in front of the camera. And it's important to have respect for all those people that work behind the camera.</li><li>It's one huge arc right until you're in your early 20s. You're always changing and always learning, but it's very much that chapter in your life: fall crazy in love, become extremely angry at little things. It's a tumultuous time.</li><li>I am the biggest geek and fan of film and TV, and I just go through phases.</li><li>It'd been about four months since shooting 'Power Rangers,' and 'Stranger Things' was the first thing I saw that made me think, 'I need this.' I had one day to get my act together, so I made a short film rather than a self-tape. It had an opening score, opening titles, and I may or may not have put on a g-string and danced to 'Hungry Like a Wolf'.</li><li>It sounds super cliche, but my sister is 12 years younger than me, and I remember when I was there holding her in my arms for the first time. And that kind of responsibility you feel when you hold a child in your arms.</li><li>I have a confession... I don't eat Vegemite, which probably makes me "un-Australian".</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d7566a39425b6997.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Facts about Aaron Phypers, Denise Richards current husband</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/842dc14a13d457e6.jpg><h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2><p class=align-left>Here are more interesting facts about the actor:</p><h3>1.
