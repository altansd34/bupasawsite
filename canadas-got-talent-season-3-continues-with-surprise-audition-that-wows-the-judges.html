Not only did the episode feature another Golden Buzzer performance, but the judges were also impressed by a singer who had no idea she would be auditioning for the show.</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-canada-s-got-talent-contestant-has-surprise-audition>Canada’s Got Talent Contestant Has Surprise Audition</h2><p>Singer Sam Babin was in the audience for Tuesday night’s show, but she didn’t realize that she would also be auditioning. Her sister nominated her to perform for the judges, leading to an impromptu performance of “Creep” by Radiohead.</p><p>After she sang, Sam said she was “thankful” for the opportunity, explaining that she wouldn’t have applied to audition herself. She said she didn’t believe she was as good as the performers you see on talent shows.</p><p>“A lot of people have no idea how difficult it is to get on a stage and sing with little to no preparation,” Kardinal Offishall shared. “And to be able to do that in front of the entire country, but still manage to deliver what you delivered tonight… You did something amazing, and you should be proud of yourself.”</p><p>All four judges voted yes to sending Sam to the next round of the competition. She still has the opportunity to win this season’s $1 million prize, courtesy of Rogers.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘CANADA’S GOT TALENT’ SEASON 3 PREMIERES WITH TWO GOLDEN BUZZERS</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-singer-earns-golden-buzzer-from-lilly-singh>Singer Earns Golden Buzzer from Lilly Singh</h2><p>Tuesday’s new episode of CGT also featured another Golden Buzzer audition, as singer Rebecca Strong took the stage to perform “Stone Cold” by Demi Lovato. Rebecca shared that she was in a band with her family when she was younger.</p><p>The judges gave Rebecca a standing ovation for her performance. Rebecca was emotional, as she shared, “I’m just very, very happy that I could touch so many people’s hearts tonight. This stage has brought me a lot of confidence and just showing who I am.”</p><p>Lilly Singh was so wowed by Rebecca’s performance that she chose to hit the Golden Buzzer, sending her straight through to the next round of the competition. Rebecca will also receive a $25,000 prize, courtesy of CIBC.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicolas-ribs-shows-off-amazing-magic>Nicolas Ribs Shows Off Amazing Magic</h2><p>During this week’s show, French magician Nicolas Ribs took the stage for an audition. You might recognize Nicolas from Season 17 of America’s Got Talent, where he reached the Finals. He also previously competed on France’s Got Talent.</p><p>For his CGT audition, Nicolas performed close-up magic on a table, interacting with the images projected onto it by bringing those objects to life. The judges were mystified by the routine, with Howie Mandel calling it “the true essence of magic.”</p><p>Nicolas received four yes votes from the judges to move on to the next round, with Howie Mandel sharing, “That’s the best magic I’ve ever seen in my history of being a talent judge.”</p><p>You can catch a new episode of Canada’s Got Talent next Tuesday night on Citytv.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/masked-singer-clock-220x124.jpg alt="Who is the Clock? ‘The Masked Singer’ Prediction & Clues!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>canada's got talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqlmpyRqHqou9Nmq5qklaPBbr%2FEmqqopl1oeqS7za2gp62VqHq4tdOhZKytoqW%2Fqr%2FEZpiunJmptrC6jK2fmqxdrLy4v4ytn55lmqqxqLHSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
