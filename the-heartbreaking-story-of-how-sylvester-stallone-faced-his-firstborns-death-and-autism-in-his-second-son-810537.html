Since 1969, the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rocky</i></a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Rambo</i></a><i> </i>writer-director has worked on&nbsp;nearly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>70&nbsp;films</a>. But there is&nbsp;usually a&nbsp;bitter truth hidden underneath a&nbsp;successful career, and Stallone had to&nbsp;climb a&nbsp;steep stairway to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;today.</p><p>Sylvester Stallone’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>path</a> demonstrates that nothing is&nbsp;impossible, no&nbsp;matter how outlandish certain dreams appear. The actor had been <a href=# title=poor data-link=tag>poor</a> since childhood, sacrificing many things to&nbsp;pursue his acting dream.</p><p>He&nbsp;had to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back and forth before he&nbsp;could sell the script for the movie “Rocky,” and he&nbsp;turned down significant sums of&nbsp;money until his offer was accepted. Stallone played Rocky on&nbsp;the big screen and rose to&nbsp;fame as&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie legend&nbsp;— the film was also a&nbsp;huge box office triumph, the first in&nbsp;a&nbsp;string of&nbsp;successes.</p><h2>Sylvester Stallone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a> family is&nbsp;“all that matters.”</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a50/fe7/57bdff50858118ac803f90e57d.jpg><p>With an&nbsp;expanding <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and many <a href=# title=divorces data-link=tag>divorces</a>, Stallone’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>personal life</a> has been as&nbsp;challenging as&nbsp;his professional life. The actor has been married 3&nbsp;times and has 2&nbsp;children from his first marriage and 3&nbsp;from his third.</p><p>He&nbsp;married Sasha Czack in&nbsp;a&nbsp;big ceremony in&nbsp;1974, but after a&nbsp;decade together, they called it&nbsp;quits. By&nbsp;1985, Stallone had fallen in&nbsp;love with model Brigitte Nielsen, but their marriage lasted only 2&nbsp;years and ended in&nbsp;a&nbsp;messy divorce that was widely publicized. However, after numerous ups and downs, Stallone met and married his current wife, Jennifer Flavin, in&nbsp;1997.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/31e/87e/a05b695ec3ba7afdba6f896238.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Sage</a> Moonblood, his eldest son, was born to&nbsp;Stallone and Czack in&nbsp;1976. Sage grew up&nbsp;following in&nbsp;his father’s footsteps, even portraying Rocky’s son in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rocky&nbsp;V</a>, but then abandoned the acting path to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;different one. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Seargeoh</a>, their second child, was born in&nbsp;1979. Despite consistently staying out of&nbsp;the spotlight, Seargeoh received cinematic credit as&nbsp;Robert “Rocky” Balboa&nbsp;Jr.&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Rocky&nbsp;II</a>, where he&nbsp;plays a&nbsp;baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/781/625/3925bb5ce7a27e5137b27d7d27.jpg><p>Stallone also has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>3&nbsp;daughters</a> from his third marriage to&nbsp;Jennifer Flavin. Sophia is&nbsp;the oldest, followed by&nbsp;Sistine and Scarlet, the youngest. They are all pursuing amazing careers, making outstanding educational achievements, and following in&nbsp;their parents’ footsteps.</p><p>The siblings have an&nbsp;extraordinary relationship and are pretty close to&nbsp;one another. “I’ve never seen such a&nbsp;close sisterhood bond. How we&nbsp;are perceived by&nbsp;paparazzi is&nbsp;really how it&nbsp;is,” Sistine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. Despite the recent announcement of&nbsp;Stallone and Flavin’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorce</a>, the family remains intact, and the actor always swears <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>to&nbsp;put his family</a> first.</p><p><h2>The autism diagnosis of&nbsp;his second child.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e66/415/09ab745a0cb7eb9f77952a11e8.jpg><p>Seargeoh, his second son, was diagnosed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>autism</a> when he&nbsp;was 3&nbsp;years old&nbsp;— his parents were concerned about his silence and took him to&nbsp;get looked&nbsp;at, and doctors verified the diagnosis. Ever since then, he&nbsp;has remained mostly out of&nbsp;the spotlight.</p><p>Stallone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> to&nbsp;crying when he&nbsp;learned about&nbsp;it. Because of&nbsp;the media attention, people constantly advised them to&nbsp;place their son in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special facility. Sylvester Stallone, however, disregarded the advice and insisted that no&nbsp;special treatment could compare to&nbsp;the comfort of&nbsp;home and family. But they made accommodations for their son’s requirements by&nbsp;ensuring he&nbsp;attended therapy sessions while being homeschooled.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/04b/361/e58fd55c91b4f702556ea14418.jpg><p>The actor was frequently absent because of&nbsp;work obligations, which left Czack to&nbsp;assume all of&nbsp;the responsibilities. “I&nbsp;knew that Sly couldn’t get as&nbsp;involved because of&nbsp;his work. We&nbsp;do&nbsp;what we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;do. So, I&nbsp;just said, ’Give me&nbsp;the money, and I’ll take care of&nbsp;it,’” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> in&nbsp;1985.</p><p>Thus, Stallone had to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;different relationship with his son. “There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;real father-and-son thing there,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>. “I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;become his playmate. With a&nbsp;child like this, you have to&nbsp;put away your ego.” But despite the challenges that come with&nbsp;it, he&nbsp;has always tried to&nbsp;do&nbsp;anything he&nbsp;could to&nbsp;assist his child, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;means creating a&nbsp;playground in&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>backyard</a>.</p><p>Along with his ex-wife, he&nbsp;established a&nbsp;research fund administered under the <i>National Society for Children and Adults With Autism</i>. “Sasha does the hard, in-the-trenches warfare,” Stallone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;use my&nbsp;films to&nbsp;have premieres that raise money for the fund.”</p><p><h2>The tragic passing of&nbsp;Sage Stallone</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f4d/6d1/bf39bd5df6b9a5e4f73be52831.jpg><p>Life has not been easy for Stallone. Besides the autism diagnosis, he&nbsp;also had to&nbsp;deal with the loss of&nbsp;his firstborn, Sage. On&nbsp;July&nbsp;13, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2012</a>, Sage, who was only 36&nbsp;years old, passed away in&nbsp;his Los Angeles apartment after a&nbsp;heart attack brought on&nbsp;by&nbsp;atherosclerosis.</p><p>Sage differed from his father, avoiding the gym and having different hobbies than him, but still, Stallone was very proud of&nbsp;him. “He&nbsp;has put <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>himself</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;position in&nbsp;which he’ll never have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;compared to&nbsp;me. I’m very proud and optimistic.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/951/e31/cb61d15ffa906e740560b88cff.jpg><p>Sage’s death has sparked much speculation, but Stallone has chosen to&nbsp;remain silent to&nbsp;honor his son’s legacy. He&nbsp;pleaded for seclusion and isolation as&nbsp;he&nbsp;mourned his son’s loss.</p><p>“When a&nbsp;parent loses a&nbsp;child, there is&nbsp;no&nbsp;greater pain,” Stallone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “Therefore, I&nbsp;am imploring people to&nbsp;respect my&nbsp;wonderfully talented son’s memory and feel compassion for his loving mother, Sasha, because this agonizing loss will be&nbsp;felt for the rest of&nbsp;our lives.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2b9/80d/60722055d4ad8e7d6c31f94a89.jpg><p>Stallone has, once again, proven his resilience and compassion, but through ups and downs, he&nbsp;has learned to&nbsp;never give up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;difficulties. The actor maintains his optimism at&nbsp;all times, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stating</a>, “It’s a&nbsp;horrible situation, but time hopefully will heal. It’s important to&nbsp;get back and try to&nbsp;start reliving your life.”</p><p>What kind of&nbsp;parent are you?
