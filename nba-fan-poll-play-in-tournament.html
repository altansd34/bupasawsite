In addition, 79 percent of those who identified as “avid” NBA fans said they were in favor of the move.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Results for the 2,200 U.S. adults surveyed in the May 12-15 survey carried a margin of error of 2 percentage points, while the margin of error among the 1,499 self-identified sports fans and 1,022 self-identified NBA fans was 3 points.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Unanimously approved by the NBA Board of Governors prior to this season, the play-in tournament gives the teams that finished the regular season ninth and 10th in each conference -- who previously would have missed the playoffs -- the opportunity to steal one of the final two postseason berths from the teams that finished seventh and eighth.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Millennial and Generation Z sports fans were more likely to approve of the play-in tournament, which is scheduled to run Tuesday through Friday, than fans from Generation X and the baby boomer generation, but even older sports fans were more likely to support the idea than to oppose it.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The play-in tournament, sponsored by insurance carrier State Farm, begins tonight with two Eastern Conference matchups on TNT: the No. 7 Boston Celtics vs. the No. 8 Washington Wizards and the No. 9 Indiana Pacers vs. the No. 10 Charlotte Hornets. The Western Conference action on ESPN begins Wednesday with the No. 7 Los Angeles Lakers vs. the No. 8 Golden State Warriors and the No. 9 Memphis Grizzlies against the No. 10 San Antonio Spurs.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In each conference, the winner of the No. 7 vs. No. 8 matchup becomes the seventh seed in the postseason, which starts Saturday, while the loser then plays the winner of the No. 9 vs. No. 10 matchup to determine the eighth seed. Four of the six games in the play-in round will result in the losing team being eliminated from playoff contention.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The league and ESPN couldn’t have asked for a more compelling play-in matchup than Lakers-Warriors, which pits generational stars James, who recently said whoever created the play-in tournament “needs to be fired,” and Stephen Curry against each other. While not technically an elimination game, the winner will be guaranteed a playoff berth, while the loser will be forced into Friday’s elimination game.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Support for the play-in concept has increased since late 2019, when it was first reported that the league was discussing the idea with the NBA Players Association and its broadcast partners.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>Morning Consult poll conducted in December 2019</a>, 51 percent of NBA fans said they favored the establishment of a play-in competition, while 21 percent dissented. The play-in tournament was considerably more popular than the 30-team, in-season tournament proposed by Commissioner Adam Silver, an idea modeled after cup competitions in European soccer that has not come to fruition.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Last week’s survey, which was conducted before matchups were finalized, found that 34 percent of U.S. adults said they were interested in the play-in tournament, including 46 percent of sports fans and half of self-identified “casual” NBA fans. Sixty-four percent of all NBA fans and 85 percent of avid NBA fans expressed interest in the new competition.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6OvonnFmqVmqJ%2BhuW68y5qwZqGeYsGwwdGnmKadnqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
