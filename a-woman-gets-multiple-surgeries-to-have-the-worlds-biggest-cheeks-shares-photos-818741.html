She insists she had a&nbsp;wonderful childhood. And happily <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a> playing with every Barbie doll imaginable, admitting that she was “spoiled”. She adds that she loved reading as&nbsp;a&nbsp;kid.</p><p><h2>Her career before becoming famous.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b6c/011/43959857b2894690c874082296.jpg><p>Before her online career took off, Anastasia struggled to&nbsp;find work. This led her to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfume shop. She had very little money and had to&nbsp;choose between finding a&nbsp;sugar daddy or&nbsp;getting a&nbsp;job. She chose the latter and started blogging about relationships. She didn’t want to&nbsp;rely on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sugar daddy, finding the idea uncomfortable. She reveals she often receives strange messages from older men offering her money, which she immediately blocks.</p><p>Anastasia spent six years at&nbsp;a&nbsp;university and has a&nbsp;master’s in&nbsp;<a href=# title=psychology data-link=tag>psychology</a>. She likes to&nbsp;inspire people to&nbsp;leave toxic relationships. Her degree has helped her in&nbsp;her job, as&nbsp;it&nbsp;helps her understand people. Many women still message her asking for relationship advice.</p><p><h2>Her first procedure and the reason behind&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0c2/df1/3e7a0e55bc85e4d1d6ebc44ebe.jpg><p>Bro needa see a therapist</p><p>Anastasia first started experimenting with her looks at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>age</a> of&nbsp;26. She got lip fillers and <a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a> for her forehead. She admits that when she saw the results, she fell in&nbsp;love with them. She candidly adds that she began her cosmetic surgery journey for herself, not for anyone else. She wanted to&nbsp;look in&nbsp;the mirror and feel beautiful. She wasn’t born with large breasts, but now she has 1050cc <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>implants</a> and thinks they’re perfect.</p><p>Anastasia also underwent a&nbsp;Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) to&nbsp;enhance her behind, among several other surgeries. Despite it&nbsp;being the most dangerous cosmetic surgery, she wasn’t scared. She believes that beauty is&nbsp;pain and that life is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;risks. The young woman has since undergone so&nbsp;many procedures that she has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lost count</a>. She has spent thousands on&nbsp;them, but she wouldn’t have it&nbsp;any other way.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/885/112/9ce4715085aeb29fd80ed9d90f.jpg><p><h2>It&nbsp;doesn’t bother her what people think.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/508/8b9/037127558c9420140514692442.jpg><p>She deformed herself and thinks it’s ok</p><p>Anastasia receives hate comments online all the time, but it’s totally different in&nbsp;real life. She reveals that people want to&nbsp;hug her and take pictures with her when she goes out. Sometimes her friends find it&nbsp;uncomfortable when people flock to&nbsp;her. They find the staring awkward, but Anastasia never feels shy.</p><p>Her mother tells her that she looked beautiful before, but now she calls her “exotic”. She considers her mother her best friend, and she’s all the support she needs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/501/33c/fe7a9a5040b30d58096fab05a9.jpg><p>While confident and happy in&nbsp;her skin now, Anastasia admits that she might consider reversing her surgeries in&nbsp;the future.</p><p>She believes that the large sum of&nbsp;money she has spent on&nbsp;altering her face over the years have only enhanced her love life. Although currently single, Anastasia boasts having a&nbsp;massive following of&nbsp;over 600,000&nbsp;on <a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>. As&nbsp;for starting a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;her own, she adds that she is&nbsp;determined to&nbsp;never give birth. Instead, she plans on&nbsp;adopting a&nbsp;child in&nbsp;need.</p><p>Another person made headlines for going through multiple surgeries to&nbsp;look like <a href=# title="Britney Spears" data-link=tag>Britney Spears</a>.
