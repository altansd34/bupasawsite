Since her mother had also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>battled</a> the same disease, indicating a&nbsp;strong family history, she had been getting mammograms every year since she turned&nbsp;35.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Nixon, the tumor in&nbsp;her breast was extremely subtle and hard to&nbsp;detect. Her doctor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>informed</a> her after the diagnosis, “You know, I&nbsp;wouldn’t have thought anything of&nbsp;this. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;so&nbsp;small, except it&nbsp;wasn’t there on&nbsp;any of&nbsp;your previous mammograms.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dfd/b76/81ce0b506bad506f22930ed513.jpg><p>Junot/Broadimage/EAST NEWS</p><p>This experience made Nixon <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realize</a> the importance of&nbsp;early screening for breast cancer. She emphasized the significance of&nbsp;undergoing regular mammograms, starting from a&nbsp;young age. Nixon believed that if&nbsp;she had started getting mammograms at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;40, they might not have been able to&nbsp;detect the cancer.</p><p><h2>But she wasn’t scared of&nbsp;her diagnosis.</h2></p><p>Being diagnosed with cancer at&nbsp;a&nbsp;young age was a&nbsp;jolting experience for Nixon. However, she quickly embraced her diagnosis and made peace with&nbsp;it. Nixon expressed her gratitude for the early detection, stating that finding it&nbsp;at&nbsp;an&nbsp;early stage allowed for immediate action to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken.</p><p>“I’ve learned that if&nbsp;you catch breast cancer early, the chances are overwhelmingly good that you’ll be&nbsp;cured,” Cynthia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>. During an&nbsp;interview, she urged women to&nbsp;face their fears and prioritize regular mammograms. Nixon conveyed that the true fear lies in&nbsp;avoiding screenings due to&nbsp;a&nbsp;reluctance to&nbsp;confront the truth.</p><p><h2>She underwent surgery between play performances.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6c1/626/838af15746b1f25b9911b88e70.jpg><p>Despite her cancer diagnosis, Nixon remained committed to&nbsp;her professional endeavors. Choosing to&nbsp;prioritize her work commitments, she opted for an&nbsp;immediate lumpectomy to&nbsp;remove the tumor.

In&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview, she shared that she didn’t want people to&nbsp;know about her operation because it&nbsp;might affect their focus. To&nbsp;accommodate her theatrical schedule, the medical procedure was scheduled on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Sunday, ensuring she wouldn’t miss any performances.</p><h2>“The only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thing</a> we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;fear is&nbsp;fear itself.”</h2><p>Following the lumpectomy, Nixon underwent six and a&nbsp;half weeks of&nbsp;radiation treatment as&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her recovery. However, she was fortunate enough to&nbsp;avoid chemotherapy, according to&nbsp;her account.
