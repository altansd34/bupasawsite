Photo by: Trae Patton/NBC Reading Time: 3 minutes Over the years, America’s Got Talent fans have been seeing the same faces on the judging panel. Apparently, while some fans do enjoy the dynamics of these recurrent judges, others believe that hiring new people for the job isn’t a bad idea.
Should the AGT Judging Panel Change? Simon Cowell, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Sofia Vergara have the power to send talented acts to the next round and reject unsatisfying ones from advancing in the competition."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Apparently, while some fans do enjoy the dynamics of these recurrent judges, others believe that hiring new people for the job isn’t a bad idea.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Should the AGT Judging Panel Change?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>, Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, and Sofia Vergara have the power to send talented acts to the next round and reject unsatisfying ones from advancing in the competition. It thus goes without saying that being a judge is a heavy responsibility, requiring one to be fair and meticulous enough to choose the right contestants.</p><p>The long running four judges have been serving in the America’s Got Talent judging panel for quite some time. Cowell has been there since season 11; Klum since season eight; Vergara since season 15. Among all in the panel, Mandel has the longest tenure, fulfilling the judging role since season 5. As a group, I believe they’ve got amazing dynamics. The occasional bantering is quite an enjoyable watch. Nonetheless, I also understand why some fans think that AGT should consider having new judges.</p><p>According to a fan from Reddit, Mandel tends to have “bad takes” while Vergara doesn’t always comment something of substance. Furthermore, a person stated that Cowell seems to have been the only one in the panel who knows how to give proper critiques. Obviously, this doesn’t ring true to some fans who view Cowell’s judging style to be “too harsh.”</p><p>“Howie’s the only one that actually drives me nuts,” one user <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>wrote</a>. “I can only take so much of him staring with amazement. Aside from that, I can tolerate everyone else.”</p><p>Seemingly, many fans are open to the idea of AGT having a new judging panel. Indeed, while the current one functions just well, a lot are curious how the series would change if there will be a new face in the judging table.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-suggest-celebrities-worth-considering-as-new-judges>Fans Suggest Celebrities Worth-Considering as New Judges</h2><p>Fans on Reddit have also been brainstorming potential replacements for the current judging panel. Interestingly enough, one user believes that celebrity chef <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gordon Ramsay</a> can fit the persona that Cowell portrays in the series. The same user believes that Jennifer Lopez can replace Sofia Vergara. This, according to them, is what AGT needs, the presence of a Latina.</p><p>Meanwhile, other users believe that there are a number of celebrities that can take Mandel’s role. Some are suggesting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Neil Patrick Harris</a>, George Lopez, and CeeLo Green. However, many fans agree that the best replacement can be Ken Jeong.</p><p>“Ken Jeong: The current ‘Masked Singer’ panelist has experience with ‘AGT: Season 13’ and would be the show’s comedic factor,” a fan <a href=# class=broken_link>wrote</a>.</p><p>America’s Got Talent has not expressed any intentions of changing its judging panel yet. Nonetheless, for fans, any changes that will make the show better is an open possibility.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_KatyPerry_Taylor-HillGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Katy Perry Shows Her Candid Side in Adorable Interview With Puppies" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZp6Ro8BuwMeipaRlmanAbsDIppxmrJ9isKmtzaCcZqyYmnq0sdGinKxlmqqxqLXNoGSpmZ6auW60xKucrGWnncZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
