As such, it is expected that Harry Potter fans would be interested in a similar <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ilvermorny sorting quiz</a>, which helps to place students into one of the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">American <i>Harry Potter</i> houses</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Isolt Sayre fled to America in an attempt to escape from her evil aunt named Gormlaith Gaunt. The latter had murdered her parents and kidnapped her to ensure that she did not get married to a muggle. With the help of a horned serpent and a few friends, Isolt began the American Wizarding School and, similar to Hogwarts, divided it into four Ilvermorny houses.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dcc5e691ac7a5639.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Celebrity price check: Music star Wizkid steps out in N1.3m denim ensemble</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dcc5e691ac7a5639.jpg><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Founding members</a> decided the name of each house. Chadwick came up with the Thunderbird house, Isolt named the Horned Serpent house, Webster named the Wampus house, and James, the Pukwudgie house. We take a look at each Ilvermorny house, the values it represents, and who it suits best.</p><h3>Thunderbird</h3><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Thunderbird</a> is quite a familiar creature in American mythology, often depicted as a magical bird with immense strength and power. The name comes from the sound made by its flapping wings. The bird spends most of its waking time in the air, a representation of freedom, travel, and intelligence. Here is a list of the characteristics of those who could be chosen into the Thunderbird house.</p><ul><li>Unpredictably intelligent</li><li>Proven adventurer</li><li>Affiliation with the power of knowledge</li><li>A deep and rational thinker</li><li>Individualistic (somewhat detached from others)</li></ul><h3>Horned Serpent</h3><p class=align-left>According to Rowling, members of the Horned Serpent house have a connection with healing. Their symbol is a horned river serpent with a visible jewel set on its head. One might think that this house is Ilvermorny’s equivalent of Hogwarts’ Slytherin house, but it is not so.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c6f1a5ca488c3ef4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>I want to help them: CEO builds house with constant electricity for his workers as a gift</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In Ilvermorny’s history, the horned serpent acted as a guide to the school’s founder, Isolt. The Horned Serpent house is Ilvermorny's equivalent of Ravenclaw. Rowling points out that Isolt always wanted to be a Ravenclaw at Hogwarts before moving to America. Additionally, she says that this mythical creature attracts proven scholars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ed5f2b1a74e92173.jpeg><p class=align-left>Here is a look at some of the traits that define members of the Horned Serpent house.</p><ul><li>Somewhat cynical (a part of you always seeks to find out how things work)</li><li>Chivalrous and honorable</li><li>Loyal with a sense of awareness</li><li>A thirst for knowledge and constant learning</li></ul><h3>Pukwudgie</h3><p class=align-left>The Pukwudgie is a big-eared, short mythical creature with a grey face. This creature exists in specific folklore, described as having human-like features despite being only two to three feet tall. One of the creature’s most prominent abilities is creating fire. This has led to its association with protection, passion, energy, and desire.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1b97cd421a9fa5f3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>2023: Yemi Osinbajo and the mighty wind by Wale Adeduro</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The first Pukwudgie that Rowling mentions is named William, an unwilling friend to Isolt. William works at Ilvermorny many years after Isolt’s death to honor her memory. It would, therefore, seem that the Pukwudgie house is Ilvermorny’s equivalent of Hufflepuff at Hogwarts. Here are some characteristics that define members of Pukwudgie.</p><ul><li>Highly individualistic</li><li>Non-judgmental</li><li>Empathetic and compassionate</li><li>Extremely open-minded</li><li>Loyal</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c6f1a5ca488c3ef4.jpg><h3>Wampus</h3><p class=align-left>The fourth house on the Ilvermorny houses quiz is called Wampus. Rowling describes the Wampus as a strong, fast, and magical panther or cougar-like creature. The creature is closely associated with earth, an element that symbolizes strength, wealth, and prosperity. Members of the Wampus house are described as extremely argumentative but totally loyal.</p><p class=align-left>Here are other defining traits of the Wampus house members.</p><ul><li>Strong instincts</li><li>Straightforward with truth and justice</li><li>Dedication to the greater good</li></ul><h2>Are there other wizardry and witchcraft schools?</h2><p class=align-left>According to J.K.Rowling, there are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">11 such schools</a> throughout the world. However, only eight of them have been revealed so far, including:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c59150e7b4613d08.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Opinion: When Lagos state politician turns his attention on the less privileged, orphans</span></p></a><ul><li>Beauxbatons Academy of Magic in France</li><li>Castelobruxo School in Brazil</li><li>Durmstrang Institute in Northern Europe</li><li>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in Scotland</li><li>Ilvermorny School in America</li><li>Koldovstoretz School in Russia</li><li>Mahoutokoro School of Magic in Japan</li><li>Uagadou School in Uganda</li></ul><p class=align-left>Similar to the sorting quiz at Hogwarts, the Ilvermorny house quiz assesses a student’s traits to help place them in the most suitable house. Taking the quiz above will help you discover your Ilvermony house.
