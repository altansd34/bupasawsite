This was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>actually</a> how the couple <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>met</a>. When Niemi was 15&nbsp;years old, she started taking dance lessons at&nbsp;the Houston Ballet Dance Company. The studio was run by&nbsp;Swayze’s mother, and that’s how they were introduced.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/82b/207/80a76e5ca3af54b97b83ce977b.jpg><p>Glen McCurtayne/COLEMAN-RAYNER/EAST NEWS</p><p>Even though they met quite early in&nbsp;life (Swayze was just 19&nbsp;years old), they could still feel the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>connection</a> between each other. Niemi recalled what it&nbsp;was like when she danced with him for the first time, saying, “I&nbsp;looked in&nbsp;his eyes, it&nbsp;was like everything came alive.”</p><p>Swayze also liked her, and they went on&nbsp;a&nbsp;few dates, but his “Casanova” moves to&nbsp;win her over didn’t work on&nbsp;Niemi. “She didn’t buy any of&nbsp;my&nbsp;nonsense. We&nbsp;spent half our dates in&nbsp;total silence, as&nbsp;she wouldn’t talk to&nbsp;me&nbsp;if&nbsp;she thought&nbsp;I was putting on&nbsp;an&nbsp;act,” Swayze revealed.</p><p>What helped him win her over was a&nbsp;truly meaningful conversation with her. Swayze also revealed how he&nbsp;felt about her at&nbsp;the time, explaining, “I&nbsp;knew she was the smartest chick I’d ever met in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life. And for a&nbsp;long time, I&nbsp;didn’t feel like&nbsp;I deserved her.”</p><p><h2>They wed in&nbsp;1975 and stayed together for 34&nbsp;years.</h2></p><p>After their <a href=# title=wedding data-link=tag>wedding</a>, they moved to&nbsp;<a href=# title="New York" data-link=tag>New York</a> to&nbsp;chase their dreams. Even though it&nbsp;wasn’t a&nbsp;smooth journey&nbsp;— Niemi wrote in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram post</a> that back then all they could afford to&nbsp;carry when going out was 25¢ in&nbsp;case they needed to&nbsp;make an&nbsp;emergency phone call&nbsp;— they still managed to&nbsp;succeed in&nbsp;the end when Swayze had his breakthrough role in&nbsp;<i>Dirty Dancing</i>.</p><p>His wife stuck by&nbsp;his side, and she was actually the inspiration for the song, “She’s Like the Wind,” from the iconic dancing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scene</a> in&nbsp;the movie. “I&nbsp;just felt at&nbsp;that time that I’m very, very lucky to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;woman who thinks&nbsp;I hung the moon,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/924/f67/8a43af5e9e9f85e8b3417b30ef.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one interview in&nbsp;1988, when Patrick was asked to&nbsp;say something about his wife, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “She literally is&nbsp;my&nbsp;creative partner. It&nbsp;just feels like there’s a&nbsp;real power between&nbsp;us. That there’s real chemistry&nbsp;— like we&nbsp;are soulmates. Like we&nbsp;knew each other before and came together in&nbsp;another life.

This was terribly difficult for him, and it&nbsp;wasn’t something he&nbsp;could just accept. He&nbsp;loved his father deeply and he&nbsp;was one of&nbsp;the most important men in&nbsp;his life, and he&nbsp;made the decision to&nbsp;spend his time on&nbsp;this Earth making his dad proud.</p><p><a href=# title=Sadly data-link=tag>Sadly</a>, for many years, he&nbsp;didn’t cope well with his father’s death. “He&nbsp;was the rock our family was built&nbsp;on,” wrote Swayze in&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>biography</a>. “A&nbsp;steady and stable presence in&nbsp;our lives. In&nbsp;some ways, we&nbsp;were nurtured more by&nbsp;my&nbsp;father than by&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a07/685/e0a5b556f4aae906011a529ea3.jpg><p>EVERETT COLLECTION/EAST NEWS</p><p>Losing his father wasn’t the only thing that took a&nbsp;toll on&nbsp;him and their relationship. Swayze and Niemi wanted to&nbsp;become parents, but their wish never came true.</p><p>In&nbsp;1990, Niemi suffered a&nbsp;miscarriage, and this was really tragic for them. “I’d been so&nbsp;excited that day, so&nbsp;thrilled at&nbsp;going to&nbsp;see my&nbsp;baby’s heartbeat, and he&nbsp;was dead,” he&nbsp;said in&nbsp;his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>autobiography</a>. “I&nbsp;couldn’t handle&nbsp;it. When we&nbsp;got to&nbsp;the parking lot, [Niemi] and&nbsp;I both wept bitterly, holding each other tight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cd1/050/c5315a579e8d44ce7a98ef01a3.jpg><p>Dariusz LEWANDOWSKI/East News</p><p>Swayze’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>depression</a> was something that he&nbsp;couldn’t get rid&nbsp;of. At&nbsp;one point, his career started to&nbsp;dwindle, and his little sister’s sudden death in&nbsp;1994 was what finally made him hit rock bottom. Despite their huge love for each other, all these tragic events left their mark, and in&nbsp;2004, the couple briefly separated.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;career break and the purchase of&nbsp;a&nbsp;remote ranch helped the couple to&nbsp;renew their relationship.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/575/7b2/fdad1c58e3b9bf94705687eedf.jpg><p>Dariusz LEWANDOWSKI/East News<span>, </span>Dariusz LEWANDOWSKI/East News</p><p>Swayze spent his time raising horses&nbsp;— <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>something</a> he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with his father&nbsp;— and he&nbsp;finally felt happiness. Thankfully, the couple’s marriage was also getting back to&nbsp;normal. “We’re a&nbsp;team,” Swayze <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>. “A&nbsp;relationship survives because of&nbsp;keeping the friendship alive and learning how to&nbsp;fall in&nbsp;love over and over again and never taking the other person for granted and seeing things in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new light with new eyes.”</p><p>However, his happy moments came with an&nbsp;expiration date, and in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2008</a>, right after he&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;acting, he&nbsp;was diagnosed with stage 4&nbsp;pancreatic cancer. This illness usually claims most victims in&nbsp;months, but Swayze beat the odds. He&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;surrender to&nbsp;the disease, and he&nbsp;filmed 13&nbsp;episodes of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV show, <i>The Beast</i>.</p><p>In&nbsp;one interview, he&nbsp;revealed that he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;keep fighting until they find a&nbsp;cure, but sadly, he&nbsp;passed away after a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>22-month</a> battle, which was a&nbsp;miracle on&nbsp;its <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>own</a>.</p><p><h2>His wife stayed by&nbsp;his side until his last breath.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a97/ee7/861e4856c283d820d9f247701b.jpg><p>Niemi spent Swayze’s final days alone with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>him</a>, holding his hand, listening to&nbsp;music, sleeping with her arm around him, her head on&nbsp;his shoulder, wordlessly.

As&nbsp;I&nbsp;had time to&nbsp;process the change my&nbsp;life was going to&nbsp;take, my&nbsp;doubts became less and less, and&nbsp;I became more and more sure,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a>.</p><p>Before the wedding, Niemi had a&nbsp;dream about Swayze, which she took as&nbsp;a&nbsp;sign. “It&nbsp;was like he&nbsp;was giving me&nbsp;his blessing and letting me&nbsp;know it&nbsp;was okay. Again, it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;hard sometimes to&nbsp;take those steps forward, but it&nbsp;doesn’t change the way we&nbsp;feel about someone.
