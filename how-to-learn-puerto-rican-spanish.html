Puerto Rican Spanish words draw influence from the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three main eras</a> of Puerto Rican history: pre-Columbian indigenous times, Spanish colonial era, and the U.S. colonial period.&nbsp;</p><p>The indigenous cultures of Puerto Rico are referred to as Taíno. Influences of different <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taíno languages</a> still exist in Puerto Rican Spanish words. For example, Puerto Ricans call themselves Boricua (Puerto Rican) from the local Taíno word for the island, Boriken.</p><p>Four hundred years as a Spanish colony not only brought the Spanish language to the Boricuas, but African languages as well. The Spanish brought enslaved people from Africa to Puerto Rico. We can still observe <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">African influence</a> on Puerto Rican Spanish words such as mofongo (a Puerto Rican dish of plantains and pork) and bochinche (gossip). Rich African influence is also evident in Puerto Rican music through samba, cumbia, and marimba.</p><p>Finally, there are a number of Puerto Rican Spanish words influenced by English from England and the U.S. such as un bonche (a bunch) and un sipi (a sip).&nbsp;</p><p>All of these cultural and historical influences combined over the course of hundreds of years, developing a distinct and beautiful Puerto Rican Spanish.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=How-to-learn-Puerto-Rican-Spanish>How to learn Puerto Rican Spanish</h2><p>The rhythm, pronunciation, words, and phrases of Puerto Rican Spanish are distinct.
