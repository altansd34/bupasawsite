Fortunately, as stated by Johnson in his June 19 Instagram story, the DWTS pro is “feeling so much better.”</p><p>“He is doing great today,” she wrote. “Basically what had happened… he was violently ill for three whole days. And by violently ill I mean, could not eat first of all, puked more than I’ve ever seen anybody in my life throw up. It was insane. All while doing four shows this past weekend.”</p><p>Subsequently, Johnson posted a video of a meal that she and her husband shared. The clip shows Chmerkovskiy sitting at a table with a plate of bacon and eggs in front of him.</p><p>“Nothing like losing 10 lbs in three days,” she wrote.</p><p>Unluckily, Chmerkovskiy had to celebrate his first ever <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Father’s Day</a> in the hospital. Describing the situation as an “adventure,” Johnson paid tribute to him via Instagram stories, which her husband shared in his personal account.</p><p>“I’m all good!” he wrote. “Thank you to everyone that came out to see us today! I gave it everything I got. Now just need to get some back.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jenna-johnson-chmerkovskiy-brothers-will-perform-as-a-trio-for-the-first-time>Jenna Johnson, Chmerkovskiy Brothers Will Perform as a Trio for the First Time</h2><p>On June 23, Johnson announced that she, Val, and Maks Chmerkovskiy will be performing together in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Savor After Hours</a>.
