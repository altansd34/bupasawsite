While sitting in front and his piano, looking casual in a black leather jacket, the AGT singer asked his supporters to sing “Fast Car” with him.</p><p>“Happy Sunday! I wanted to share this cover of Fast Car with you,” he wrote.</p><p>The singer-songwriter impressively belted out the lyrics of the song as he was playing the keys. Due to Lee’s reputation as an amazing performer, it’s no surprise that he has captured the hearts of his followers once again. Several fans took to the comments of the post to express their appreciation for Lee’s voice.</p><p>“You give me goosebumps every time I hear you sing,” one fan commented. “Always put me in a better place.”</p><p>“Tracy Chapman needs to see this!” another person wrote.</p><p>“He makes me wanna live cause I’m also going blind and scared to death. He’s my hero,” another commented.</p><p>“Fast Car” is the lead single off Chapman’s self-titled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">debut album</a>. During the song’s release year, it reached the no. 6 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. It also snatched a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. In 2021, Rolling Stone listed “Fast Car” on the 71st spot on its “500 Greatest Songs of All Time.” The online outlet described the same as “a haunting rumination on poverty and escape that touched a nerve.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-s-been-doing-a-series-of-covers>He’s Been Doing a Series of Covers</h2><p>It seems that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lee</a> has been enjoying performing covers on social media. On October 4, he uploaded a cover of “Stand By Me” by Ben E. King.</p><p>A few days later, he sang “Yellow” by Coldplay. The AGT winner is obviously making efforts to match the song, wearing a sparkly yellow jacket while doing the cover.</p><p>Then, Lee performed a newly released pop song. Belting out “Vampire” with his powerful vocals, we bet Olivia Rodrigo would be thrilled.</p><p>“Beautiful job Kodi!! As always,” a fan wrote.</p><p>“I have to say that this song is not a favorite of mine, but I’m still amazed how you do what you do!” another fan commented.</p><p>In current day, Lee is one of the performers apart of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">America’s Got Talent Superstars</a> Las Vegas residency line up. There, the singer performs covers songs by powerhouses like Hozier and the late, great Tina Turner.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_JoJoSiwa_SpecialForces_Pete-Dadds-FOX-220x147.jpeg alt="JoJo Siwa Reveals She Braided Tom Sandoval’s Hair Everyday for ‘Special Forces: World’s Toughest Test’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZquklr9ut86doGaklZp6scHTrGShoaNivLi6jKynoqZdpLtuwNGamrJlk52usbnAp6pmnpGowW6vwKtm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
