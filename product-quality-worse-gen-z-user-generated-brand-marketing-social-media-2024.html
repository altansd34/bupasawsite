Even the cast of NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” which just last week ran a skit <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>lamenting the ills</a> of fast fashion, seems pressed about the overall state of craftsmanship.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A new Morning Consult survey quantifies the extent to which these narratives have permeated the general public, finding that 38% of U.S. adults believe companies now care “less” about making quality products than in the past. That’s roughly equal to the share who believe companies care “about the same,” (37%) but much larger than the share who said they care “more” (15%).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Higher shares of Gen Z adults feel negatively, however, and their penchant for seeking out shopping advice online is likely at play.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Gen Z’s opinion on product quality is in the red</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As videos bemoaning modern product quality continue to attract large audiences online, close to half (44%) of Gen Z adults said brands are no longer committed to producing high-quality goods.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A majority of this kind of content has gone after clothing retailers, and a separate survey question revealed that Gen Z adults view the apparel industry as the worst product quality offender. Meanwhile, categories like technology and beauty are faring a bit better.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">There is certainly <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>some evidence</a> to suggest that product quality <i>actually has</i> gotten worse over the years. But repeated exposure to sweeping negative characterizations online appears to be entrenching this idea in the minds of Gen Z consumers, posing reputational risk (albeit mild) for many brands. Popular narratives around declining product quality could also further intensify Gen Zers’ already-strong inclination for <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>brand-switching</a>.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>For Gen Z, what is said online often goes</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Gen Z adults are 14 percentage points more likely than the average consumer to consult user-generated content on social media when looking to make a purchase (44% versus 30%, respectively). And while this behavior sits behind others like reading reviews directly on brands’ websites, it’s still an important part of the Gen Z shopping journey.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">A key group driving online conversations about brands and products, of course, is influencers — who young people <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>increasingly trust</a> to deliver sound advice on these topics.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Still, not <i>all</i> posts can be sponsored. Consumers have free will to publicly share their experiences with brands, good or bad — and psychology tells us that the latter is <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>much more likely</a> than the former. Plus, as the creator economy matures, influencers are getting <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>more comfortable</a> criticizing their brand partners for any less than ideal behavior.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">That’s all to say — brands have a diminishing amount of control over their messaging online, a channel where creative control was already limited to begin with. Negative narratives do circulate, and without certain safeguards in place, they can flourish — especially among young, culture-driving consumers who place a premium on information gleaned from internet peers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>Protecting against unpredictable internet storylines</strong></h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">To mitigate that possibility and work toward fostering loyalty among Gen Z shoppers instead, companies should consider investing in social listening and digital community management programs.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The former allows for always-on visibility into trending consumer narratives, which can then be used to inform compelling, real-time messaging. For example, if a post goes viral calling out a brand’s false advertising of premium materials, that could be enough of a prompt for competitors to send out an email blast highlighting their own product quality prowess.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The latter ensures companies can quickly and directly engage with consumers — a function that becomes especially important if and when a brand finds themselves the target of the internet’s ire.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Ultimately, brands will always be subject to the whims of social media and the savvy Gen Zers who rule it. Previous Morning Consult research shows that most companies <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>can recover</a> from one-off viral incidents, but persistent negative buzz presents bigger challenges. A proactive approach is the best bet for those looking to future-proof their online presence.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqqKrX6W%2FsLDUnKtmqaWWuarA2GauqKqjmnqosc1msWato5q%2FbrPEp5yrmaSasW6u0ZqlnWWdlr%2BssdOipaBlo6Swqq3LZqSenJmWenN8kW0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
