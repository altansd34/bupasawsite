In the list were six male pros and seven female pros — absent Motsepe’s name. Apparently, this has sparked a curious conversation on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Reddit</a> among fans who seem to be missing his presence on DWTS.</p><p>“Nobody talks to him anymore and he has his comments permanently turned off and is hardly on instagram anymore when he used to be on all the time. There’s a story there, we just don’t know what it is but it feels like more than him just being cut,” one Reddit user wrote.</p><p>Motsepe entered DWTS as a pro on season 19 with bobsledder Lolo Jones, he then returned for season 20 with actress/model Charlotte McKinney. In both seasons, Motsepe and his partner were one of the first pairs to leave the competition. Motsepe then continued to appear on the show for seven seasons, failing to advance far during most times. He made it to the Semi-finals for the first time in season 27 when he competed with actress Evanna Lynch.</p><p>“Keo definitely deserved better. I still remember his IG story when he first met Evanna, he seemed so excited. At least we’ll always have that face he gave us when Bobby won. I do hope to see him back some day though,” one person wrote.</p><p>Another fan expressed that it’s “sad” that the show “never gave him a chance to win the mirrorball.” They went on to state that DWTS had always given him partners who couldn’t dance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-was-upset-when-he-wasn-t-cast-in-season-30>He Was Upset When He Wasn’t Cast in Season 30</h2><p>The last time that Motsepe was involved in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dancing With The Stars</a> was on season 29. At the time, he competed alongside partner Anne Heche. Unfortunately, when season 30 was about to unfold, it was revealed that Motsepe wasn’t given the opportunity to be on the show. During his interview with Us Weekly, he deemed the news “disappointing.”</p><p>“While it’s disappointing to not be back for season 30, I’ve been honored to be on the last nine seasons of the show and look forward to returning in the future. There’s a great group this season and I wish all the dancers and the show the best of luck,” he said. “I also have some exciting opportunities in the works, so don’t worry, you’ll be seeing me again soon enough.”</p><p>At present, Motsepe is not intensely active on his social media. Nonetheless, he’s left crumbs of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> experience on his Instagram highlights. He also posted a tribute to late head judge Len Goodman when he died in April 2023.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/NUP_196227_04003.jpg alt="Ariana Grande Says She Stopped Using Lip Fillers, Botox in 2018" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>keo motsepe</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w7CrrGWWlru0edaopZ2domLEqcWMqamoZZuavG65zq2qnqiVYsC2sMOepaWxXZm2tK3PqZyaqpWZeqe%2BzqZkraCVYsCpu9Zo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
