It’s a&nbsp;list of&nbsp;all the things we&nbsp;want and need, how much it&nbsp;will cost, how much we&nbsp;saved for&nbsp;it, and when we&nbsp;should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;have&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;has things like new fridge, <a href=# title=dishwasher data-link=tag>dishwasher</a>, nice knife set, wish list items, etc. I&nbsp;even include pictures, model numbers, or&nbsp;other specific descriptions for a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;these items. I’m very proud of&nbsp;it.</p><p>My&nbsp;father and his wife come to&nbsp;visit on&nbsp;a&nbsp;semiregular basis. My&nbsp;stepmom always makes sure to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;my&nbsp;board, comment on&nbsp;it, and express her sadness that we&nbsp;are unable to&nbsp;afford the stuff. Within a&nbsp;week or&nbsp;so, she will buy one of&nbsp;the exact things on&nbsp;my&nbsp;board for herself. Sometimes it’s a&nbsp;smaller item like the coffee maker, other times it’s a&nbsp;larger item, like a&nbsp;motorized toy car for her children.</p><p>Her buying these things isn’t really what bugs&nbsp;me; what bugs me&nbsp;is&nbsp;her rubbing it&nbsp;in&nbsp;my&nbsp;face that she was able to ’get it&nbsp;first’ or&nbsp;how&nbsp;I was ’copying’ her when I&nbsp;do finally get the item. It’s super annoying and childish.”</p><p>"Anyway, I&nbsp;was walking through a&nbsp;local store’s Christmas section right after Thanksgiving. I&nbsp;was looking for board ideas and happened upon a&nbsp;giant, ugly (in&nbsp;my&nbsp;opinion), super pricey outdoor Christmas decorations set. It&nbsp;gave me&nbsp;an&nbsp;idea. It&nbsp;was definitely not my&nbsp;stepmom’s style. But hey, why not try?</p><p>When I&nbsp;got home, I&nbsp;put the set on&nbsp;the high priority section of&nbsp;my&nbsp;board. Going as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;to&nbsp;erase the <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a>&nbsp;I had pooled for other things and move it&nbsp;to&nbsp;this Christmas monstrosity so&nbsp;we&nbsp;could ’buy’ it&nbsp;sooner. I&nbsp;was hoping this trap would be&nbsp;tempting enough for my&nbsp;stepmom, especially if&nbsp;I made this set seem super important.</p><p>A&nbsp;couple days after that, my&nbsp;father and stepmom visit. My&nbsp;stepmom looks at&nbsp;my&nbsp;board and asks about the set. I&nbsp;gush over&nbsp;it, describing it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the way to&nbsp;make my&nbsp;Christmas dreams come true. I&nbsp;really lay it&nbsp;on&nbsp;thick.</p><p>On&nbsp;Monday, we&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;visit my&nbsp;dad at&nbsp;my&nbsp;stepmom’s request. Sure as&nbsp;everything, she bought and put up&nbsp;the entire set. It’s ugly and over the top. I&nbsp;hate&nbsp;it. It’s hilarious. Immediately she dives into to&nbsp;describing why she just ’fell in&nbsp;love with it’ and how she ’had to&nbsp;have it,’ making a&nbsp;huge deal on&nbsp;every little piece and how it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;worth the money. Finally, she concludes her gloat fest with telling me&nbsp;that&nbsp;I really do&nbsp;have great taste and sorry she beat me&nbsp;to&nbsp;it.</p><p>I&nbsp;tell her, “Oh, I&nbsp;don’t actually like the set. I&nbsp;just put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the board and said&nbsp;I liked it&nbsp;to&nbsp;mess with [husband]. He&nbsp;hates the over the top stuff like this. Glad <i>you</i> love&nbsp;it, though.” If&nbsp;her smile fell any harder, it&nbsp;would have fallen right off her face. The rest of&nbsp;the visit she was quite, didn’t say much. She looked like a&nbsp;kid who got coal for Christmas. My&nbsp;dad kept asking her what was wrong and got a&nbsp;lot of ’I’m fines’ and then finally she got a&nbsp;headache and went to&nbsp;bed early.</p><p>Soon after, she also put up&nbsp;the decorations on&nbsp;a&nbsp;Facebook sell group this morning for pickup after Christmas. She now refuses to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;me, none of&nbsp;her usual texts or&nbsp;calls."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuwNGimqSdlGK6unnSrZyppZ%2Bieqq606hkm62pnruoecKhqaKrpKKutHnDnpqoqpGptrC60maqoZ1dmbalutNmrpqmpGKur7CMp6awZaOdsm7DzqerZqyRobhuwM5mpJ5laGaDen%2BRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
