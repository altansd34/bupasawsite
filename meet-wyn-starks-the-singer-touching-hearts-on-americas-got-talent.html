As he shared in his audition, he had a twin brother who sadly passed away in 2020. Wyn relocated to Nashville to pursue music, and according to his <a href=#>website</a>, he signed a record deal with Curb Records after just six months.</p><p>The singer released his debut single, “Circles,” in 2019. In his AGT audition, Wyn shared that he got laid off from his hotel job during the Covid-19 pandemic, which “forced me into music full-time.” In 2020, he released an EP titled Who I Am, featuring the song he performed on the show.</p><p>Then in 2021, Wyn released his debut album, titled Black Is Golden. It features 11 songs, including previously released tracks. On his website, the project is described as “both a&nbsp;rallying cry for people of color and an inclusive call to the dance floor for all races.”</p><p>Before his AGT audition aired, Wyn released an official music video for “Who I Am.” The clip is mostly in black and white, featuring segments of animation and fantastical imagery. At the end of the video, it changes to color.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>WILL ALEX RIVERS GO AS FAR AS PAST ‘AMERICA’S GOT TALENT’ VIOLINISTS?</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Wyn shared in <a href=#>an interview</a> that when he was younger, he “wanted to be a lawyer and fight for social justice.” He didn’t end up becoming a lawyer, but he still pursues social change through his music. For instance, he released a song called “Sparrow” after the death of George Floyd.</p><p>He said the incident, which happened in his hometown of Minneapolis, made him want to “get back to that part of myself and that fight for people.” Wyn said his music is also influenced by his journey coming out as queer.</p><p>“It’s just something that’s important to me, because I wouldn’t be where I was if it wasn’t for people who fought for me to be here,” Wyn said.&nbsp;“I want to be able to do that for somebody else, you know? That’s why I like to incorporate that in my music.”</p><p>Wyn received three “yes” votes from the judges to move on in the competition. We can’t wait to find out what else he has in store as the season goes on.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Original_DemiLovato_RichFury_GettyImagesforGlobalCitizen.jpg alt="Demi Lovato Injures Face Ahead of Song Release, Talk Show Appearance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Wyn Starks</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWnrrtuv9OaqaSrXam1pnnSoqWgnaJiwbDBwqGgp59dnbKivtOsZKimXZa6pr7InJisZZekwW7AwKWcp6xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
