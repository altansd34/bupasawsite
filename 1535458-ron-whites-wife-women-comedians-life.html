They had one son together, Marshall White. The pair kept their relationship out of the limelight and never revealed why they divorced. Their son Marshall stayed with his father after their divorce. Lori has also remained away from the spotlight since their separation in 1993.</p><h4>Barbara Dobbs</h4><p class=align-left>Eleven years after his first marriage ended, the comic married again. He tied the knot with his second wife, Barbara Dobbs, in 2004. Dobbs is an interior designer who previously worked for Jeff Foxworthy, an American radio and <a href=#>television personality</a>. The couple had no children together, and Barbara has shied away from the public since their divorce.</p><h4>Margo Rey</h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/37e7bf7664f4d042.jpg><p class=align-left>Margo ‘Rey’ Reymundo is a Mexican singer, songwriter, and cancer survivor. Ron and Margo met through the singer’s older brother, Alex Reymundo, a <a href=#>Mexican actor</a> and stand-up comedian. Margo was performing, and her brother invited White to watch her show. He went even though he didn’t want to and was instantly attracted to her when watching her performance.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/6268ce60bd0825fd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Jennifer Hudson have a husband?

Their events often blended concerts and comedy shows, with Alex included.</p><p class=align-left>The pair got married on 13 October 2013 in California. They lived in Montecito in Santa Barbara County, California.

When she tried to pay for the consultation, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she discovered</a> that Ron had cut her off from their joint finances and cancelled all her credit cards. The comic had allegedly also changed all the locks to their house.

In 2019, a court upheld the marriage, causing White to pay the singer $25K monthly in spousal support.</p><p class=align-left>Although Margo and Ron haven’t been together for over five years, her brother Alex still works with Ron.
