His friends were everything to&nbsp;him.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8f/c61/1e766758bd968fb4535a694a08.jpg><p>His friend, actress Juliet Stevenson, <a href=#>told</a> a&nbsp;story of&nbsp;how Alan would use his <a href=# title="Harry Potter" data-link=tag>Harry Potter</a> honorariums to&nbsp;care for his friends. When they went out for dinner with him and someone tried to&nbsp;pay, Alan would always sneak out first and pay with his credit card. This way, he&nbsp;made sure that no&nbsp;one could even have the opportunity to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;the check. If&nbsp;someone tried to&nbsp;object, he&nbsp;just replied, “I’ve got two words for you: Harry Potter.”</p><p><h2>2. He&nbsp;helped people not give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;themselves.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bc5/c30/ed9c955035a65c33c702eb75ec.jpg><p>Another <a href=#>friend</a> said, “He&nbsp;desperately wanted people to&nbsp;use all their talent, and he&nbsp;hated it&nbsp;when friends talked themselves down. Once, I&nbsp;laughingly said: ’The university suggested I&nbsp;do a&nbsp;doctorate, but I’m not bright enough to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;Ph.D.’ He&nbsp;scolded me&nbsp;for underestimating my&nbsp;own potential, for taking the easy way out by&nbsp;not taking on&nbsp;something tough but achievable seriously. He&nbsp;took me&nbsp;back to&nbsp;his flat and sat me&nbsp;down with his partner, Rima, who was a&nbsp;lecturer, and from that moment sprang the first step to&nbsp;me&nbsp;becoming Dr. Peter Kyle.”</p><p><h2>3. He&nbsp;was always eager to&nbsp;share his experience.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9d5/01d/b4f16f5d929e57295d52fd0e1a.jpg><p>His fellow actors often admired Alan for how much he&nbsp;guided, <a href=# title=motivated data-link=tag>motivated</a>, and looked after them throughout their careers. One of&nbsp;them <a href=#>shared</a>: “Alan Rickman was one of&nbsp;my&nbsp;first heroes. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;an&nbsp;ex-pupil at&nbsp;my&nbsp;school and did the most inspiring Q&A session with&nbsp;us when&nbsp;I was there. One bit of&nbsp;advice he&nbsp;gave was to ’make sure you constantly do&nbsp;things that make you get out of&nbsp;bed in&nbsp;the morning.’ It&nbsp;stuck with&nbsp;me. And when Hans Gruber, the Sherriff of&nbsp;Nottingham, Colonel Brandon, Jamie, and Snape tell you how to&nbsp;live your life&nbsp;— you listen.”</p><p><h2>4. He&nbsp;took charity very seriously.</h2></p><p>Back in&nbsp;the ’90s, a&nbsp;<a href=#>friend</a> of&nbsp;Alan’s was part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;small group of&nbsp;people setting up&nbsp;an&nbsp;aid agency. The organization needed money to&nbsp;support its operations. Alan had volunteered to&nbsp;help and put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;show at&nbsp;the Brighton Dome to&nbsp;raise money. But handing over a&nbsp;check was never enough for him. They flew together to&nbsp;North-East Romania to&nbsp;work in&nbsp;an&nbsp;orphanage supported by&nbsp;the money he&nbsp;helped raise. Kids loved him.</p><p>He&nbsp;was involved in&nbsp;<a href=#>charitable</a> activities throughout his life and continuously worked to&nbsp;support people in&nbsp;need. He&nbsp;reportedly <a href=#>gave</a> £100,000 ($137,000) to&nbsp;charity in&nbsp;his will.</p><p><h2>5. He&nbsp;remained a&nbsp;gentleman in&nbsp;any situation.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89a/ec9/77a5835a29b1a88c844141b293.jpg><p>One reporter shared her <a href=#>experience</a> working with him: “I&nbsp;had the enormous pleasure to&nbsp;interview Alan several times as&nbsp;a&nbsp;journalist. When I&nbsp;spilled a&nbsp;drink on&nbsp;my&nbsp;dress during an&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;just took me&nbsp;by&nbsp;the hand and across the street to&nbsp;a&nbsp;really nice store to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;new one for&nbsp;me.”</p><p><h2>6. He&nbsp;never looked down at&nbsp;his young colleagues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c34/b03/16b2e8578787f9a1ba62e4e17e.jpg><p>Justin Long remembered his <a href=#>experience</a> at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;his career, when he&nbsp;got to&nbsp;work with Alan: “When I&nbsp;got to&nbsp;work with him on&nbsp;Galaxy Quest, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;very wide-eyed young actor doing my&nbsp;very first movie. It&nbsp;spoiled&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;treated everyone the same. He&nbsp;always sat and ate his lunch with the crew. He’d stay and do&nbsp;off-camera for the other actors. He&nbsp;was equally generous with his downtime, letting me&nbsp;and Jeremy Howard pick his brain like hungry young acting vultures.”</p><p><h2>7. He&nbsp;wasn’t afraid to&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;himself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0f7/d1c/fa24c2597cb3981c225709e7de.jpg><p>The actor’s first cinematic role was the character of&nbsp;Hans Gruber in&nbsp;Die Hard. Even though this part brought him a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;recognition, he&nbsp;sincerely <a href=#>joked</a> about the way he&nbsp;got the role: “I&nbsp;got Die Hard because&nbsp;I came cheap. They were paying <a href=# title="Bruce Willis" data-link=tag>Bruce Willis</a> $7&nbsp;million, so&nbsp;they had to&nbsp;find people they could pay nothing.”</p><p><h2>8. He&nbsp;loved children.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/428/411/f5b29e5a8183b96bd21d49809f.jpg><p>Throughout his rich career, Rickman built a&nbsp;reputation as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor who played very serious roles. However, at&nbsp;heart, he&nbsp;was the kindest person and was very close to&nbsp;little children. During the filming of&nbsp;Harry Potter, Alan could be&nbsp;seen in&nbsp;his full Professor Snape costume surrounded by&nbsp;a&nbsp;crowd of&nbsp;little <a href=#>kids</a> playfully chatting with him.</p><p>A&nbsp;lady told another touching <a href=#>story</a> of&nbsp;her encounter with Rickman when she was still very young: “When I&nbsp;was 6, I&nbsp;met Alan Rickman at&nbsp;a&nbsp;party. I&nbsp;got scared, but he&nbsp;promised me&nbsp;he&nbsp;wasn’t Snape. When I&nbsp;was leaving, he&nbsp;blew me&nbsp;a&nbsp;kiss.”</p><p><h2>9. His fans were very important to&nbsp;him.</h2></p><p>“This was outside the stage door at&nbsp;the Golden Theater in&nbsp;Manhattan. My&nbsp;sister and&nbsp;I saw him perform in&nbsp;Seminar, and he&nbsp;was amazing. He&nbsp;had tons of&nbsp;fans waiting for autographs, and he&nbsp;took the time to&nbsp;sign everything. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;wonderful experience,” a&nbsp;fan<a href=#> remembered</a>.</p><p><h2>10. And he&nbsp;would go&nbsp;the extra mile to&nbsp;bring happiness to&nbsp;them.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e5/744/cfda325ae29be21ed50ede7a0a.jpg><p>Which is&nbsp;your favorite Alan Rickman character?
