Of the transport methods YouGov London Omnibus asked Londoners about, two thirds (66%) say they feel comfortable using trains, including Overground services, with one in five (21%) are very comfortable doing so."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Over half (52%) of Londoners feel safe using the service, but 44% do not - the highest proportion of the transport types we asked about.</p><p>Men in the capital are more comfortable with the idea of taking the Tube (60%) than women, of whom less than half (45%) would feel comfortable doing so.</p><p>When it comes to taxis, Londoners say they would feel more comfortable in a black cab than using an app-based taxi service. Approaching two thirds (62%) say they would be comfortable using black cabs, compared to 56% who would feel comfortable in another type of taxi.</p><p>Londoners are least likely to feel comfortable using bike hire schemes, such as Boris Bikes, with only 39% happy to take one for a spin. However it is worth noting that not all Londoners will be able to ride a bike, and this answer option returned a higher “don’t know” response (21%) than other options.</p><p><strong><a href=#>Learn more about YouGov London Omnibus and other CityBus Research here</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>See full results here</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwbOt1Z6jaJmiqbakuMSsZmxpaWyCbpjOp5uoppWnwG6vzqadqKqkYqGHmIycpq%2BhlGLBs63VnqNmpJ%2BjsbC6</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
