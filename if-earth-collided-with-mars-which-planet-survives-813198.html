Another planet... right next to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=Moon data-link=tag>Moon</a>! A&nbsp;big red one. At&nbsp;first, everyone’s excited. <a href=# title=Mars data-link=tag>Mars</a> showing up&nbsp;out of&nbsp;nowhere is&nbsp;having a&nbsp;strange effect on&nbsp;humanity.</p><p>Just as&nbsp;the moon can affect the psychological and physical state of&nbsp;some people, Mars’s unexpected visit is&nbsp;causing people to&nbsp;behave pretty strangely. Every night, the sky is&nbsp;lit up&nbsp;by&nbsp;the white light of&nbsp;the Moon and the red glow of&nbsp;Mars.</p><p>Many people get a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;instant <a href=# title=insomnia data-link=tag>insomnia</a>. Some even stop drinking <a href=# title=coffee data-link=tag>coffee</a> because they no&nbsp;longer feel sleepy. Mars brings out the <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a> and a&nbsp;little wildness in&nbsp;people, makes them laugh more, and even drives a&nbsp;few poor people crazy. They begin to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out of&nbsp;their houses more often and enjoy the unusual night sky.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/156/7be/9df2af53ffa4deacc2f3b578f2.png><p>A&nbsp;few days later, everybody can see what’s happening... Mars is&nbsp;getting bigger. Scientists announce that the red planet is&nbsp;slowly moving towards Earth. A&nbsp;collision is&nbsp;inevitable! Earthlings only have a&nbsp;few years left! A&nbsp;few months ago, a&nbsp;huge asteroid crashed into the red planet with such force that Mars simply flew out of&nbsp;its own orbit and went rogue. The chance that Mars would fly close to&nbsp;Earth was always going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;pretty high. After about 3&nbsp;seconds of&nbsp;being announced, the news went viral. And panic set&nbsp;in.</p><p>The situation’s getting worse and worse. The closer Mars gets, the more it&nbsp;affects people on&nbsp;a&nbsp;physical level. Hundreds of&nbsp;videos pop&nbsp;up, showing <strong>collision simulations of&nbsp;Mars and Earth</strong>. And there’s no&nbsp;happy ending. “Want to&nbsp;see what happens?”&nbsp;— one famous blogger asks her followers. “The Earth’s almost completely covered with water, and Mars is&nbsp;all dust, sand, and <a href=# title=rocks data-link=tag>rocks</a>!” Then she puts a&nbsp;huge watermelon in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;her room. From the far end, she launches a&nbsp;bowling ball at&nbsp;it. Strike.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1cd/d45/414a8c512c956dd689be8247b2.png><p>Mars looks almost the same size as&nbsp;the Moon now. It’s about to&nbsp;come into the moon’s orbit, and it’s affecting the Earth’s magnetic field. Floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, powerful thunderstorms... they go&nbsp;from bad to&nbsp;worse. <a href=# title=Animals data-link=tag>Animals</a> go&nbsp;crazy, birds no&nbsp;longer migrate south, the Polar Northern Lights appear in&nbsp;the Caribbean!</p><p>The economy isn’t handling the news that well. People stop showing up&nbsp;to&nbsp;work, why wouldn’t they? They just want to&nbsp;have fun and be&nbsp;with loved ones. There are enough resources on&nbsp;the planet to&nbsp;last until the catastrophe, so&nbsp;no&nbsp;one’s even trying to&nbsp;fix the Earth’s problems. Clothing, food, cars, yachts, whatever&nbsp;— everything loses its value and becomes free!<strong> </strong>Every day, huge street parties pop up&nbsp;all over the world. People decide to&nbsp;live their last months in&nbsp;peace and harmony. The global catastrophe’s uniting humanity like never before!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8e7/c8b/4e44b65fabab343cb2d873c981.png><p>To&nbsp;go&nbsp;out with a&nbsp;bang, Earthlings team up&nbsp;to&nbsp;organize a&nbsp;huge rock concert. The red giant destroying our beautiful blue planet... Yeah, Rock’n’roll’s the perfect soundtrack. There’s just enough time to&nbsp;eat, dance, party, and listen to&nbsp;good music. Huge stages are built all over the planet, it’s every musician’s last concert! During all that preparation, <strong>hope</strong> suddenly appears. Scientists have calculated all the events that’ll occur when Mars crashes into Earth, and they have a&nbsp;<strong>simple <a href=# title=plan data-link=tag>plan</a></strong>. Luckily, humans had already planned on&nbsp;moving to&nbsp;Mars, so&nbsp;they’d already been building spaceships for years.</p><p>There’s no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;get to&nbsp;another planet before the collision, but the good news is&nbsp;that people can wait out the disaster just outside Earth’s orbit. You’ll get to&nbsp;sit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;space station, munch some popcorn, relax, and enjoy the show. When the dust settles, it&nbsp;might just be&nbsp;possible to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;Earth. Or&nbsp;what’s left of&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/093/d03/e0f84256319a7a9559bbb948e3.png><p>After learning about this plan, people start working on&nbsp;finishing the ships night and day, everyone in&nbsp;the world pitches&nbsp;in. There are still <strong>two years</strong> left before the big day. The huge concert stages are converted into more space stations. Mars is&nbsp;now giving people more energy, and with epic teamwork, people manage to&nbsp;create thousands of&nbsp;stations in&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few months. That’s what happens when 7&nbsp;billion people work together! Farmers, physical therapists, chefs, engineers, athletes, accountants... all on&nbsp;the same team!</p><p>Mars is&nbsp;now closer to&nbsp;us than the moon. The red giant blocks out the sun, and our planet is&nbsp;plunged into darkness. There are only a&nbsp;few days left. People are working like ants in&nbsp;a&nbsp;massive colony, putting the finishing touches on&nbsp;several hundred thousand space stations! It&nbsp;takes four whole days for everyone to&nbsp;get on&nbsp;board, plus there’s the loading of&nbsp;supplies: <strong>animals</strong>, <strong><a href=# title=fish data-link=tag>fish</a></strong>, <strong>seeds</strong>, <strong>plants</strong>, <strong>vegetables</strong>, <strong><a href=# title=fruits data-link=tag>fruits</a></strong>, <strong>video games</strong>, <strong>fruit roll-ups</strong>...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ea4/7a1/34083b5d808ecd2f599d62822e.png><p>The red giant is&nbsp;scheduled to&nbsp;enter Earth’s orbit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;days, that’s when it’ll really pick-up speed. Mars is&nbsp;only a&nbsp;little more than half the size of&nbsp;Earth, but up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the sky... it&nbsp;looks infinitely huge. The ships start taking off. People take a&nbsp;last look around, memorizing every inch. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;few hours, it’ll all change forever. The stations fly&nbsp;up, far enough away to&nbsp;clear any orbits. Two worlds colliding together should still have a&nbsp;soundtrack, though. Rock stars on&nbsp;every ship organize an&nbsp;outer space music festival.</p><p>To&nbsp;the awesome sound of&nbsp;Rock, Mars enters Earth’s <a href=# title=atmosphere data-link=tag>atmosphere</a> and burns a&nbsp;thin layer of&nbsp;its own surface. This releases an&nbsp;incredible amount of&nbsp;energy. It&nbsp;gets faster and faster and smashes into the Pacific Ocean. A&nbsp;huge blast wave sweeps across the entire planet. Everything is&nbsp;lit up&nbsp;by&nbsp;flames, and everyone on&nbsp;the ship has to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;sunglasses to&nbsp;avoid being blinded. Our blue planet is&nbsp;turning into a&nbsp;fiery one.</p><p>The dust of&nbsp;Mars mixes with the water of&nbsp;Earth. The force of&nbsp;the impact goes through the earth’s crust, into the liquid hot magma. Hundreds of&nbsp;pieces of&nbsp;Mars, some the size of&nbsp;entire countries, are somehow floating in&nbsp;the atmosphere. The collision generates so&nbsp;much energy that all oceans boil and evaporate. Seas and rivers of&nbsp;molten metal are now spreading all over Earth. Days, weeks, months pass. A&nbsp;belt made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;bits of&nbsp;Mars forms around the Earth. It’s like a&nbsp;fiery version of&nbsp;Saturn.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b07/55e/3bee7e517fbd5618815db5102a.png><p>It’ll take a&nbsp;long time before it’s safe to&nbsp;land back down, but humanity can’t stay alive on&nbsp;the ships all that time. <strong>Food</strong>, <strong>water</strong>, and <strong>oxygen </strong>will run out after a&nbsp;few years. But scientists already have a&nbsp;plan. The ships flip a&nbsp;switch and become huge cryo-chambers. The ships are equipped with energy panels, and the roasting hot Earth’s giving off a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;energy, totally enough to&nbsp;keep the ships working while everyone onboard takes a&nbsp;few thousand-year nap. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the planet cools down, humans will wake&nbsp;up.</p><p>Hundreds of&nbsp;thousands of&nbsp;years pass. One day, alarms go&nbsp;off simultaneously on&nbsp;all the ships. People wake&nbsp;up, slowly. Their bodies are exhausted, but after a&nbsp;few billion cups of&nbsp;coffee, everyone’s ready to&nbsp;go! Down on&nbsp;Earth, new continents should have formed, and the atmosphere’s most likely way different. The planet might have lost its original orbit, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;spinning at&nbsp;a&nbsp;different angle. The seasons as&nbsp;we&nbsp;used to&nbsp;know them, gone. All the water on&nbsp;Earth evaporated in&nbsp;the first few hours, but there were huge glaciers on&nbsp;Mars, which might’ve melted on&nbsp;impact? Mars may have shared its water with our planet!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2e7/62b/86d93b5347a59a654963c15879.png><p>The clouds of&nbsp;dust and dirt should’ve settled by&nbsp;now, and the ground should be&nbsp;pretty good for growing stuff&nbsp;on... all that magma probably spewed up&nbsp;a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;useful minerals and chemicals. It’s going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;difficult, but humanity somehow must adapt to&nbsp;the new Earth. People are ready for anything! All the earthlings run to&nbsp;the nearest windows to&nbsp;see what their beloved planet looks like after all these centuries.</p><p>Um... where is&nbsp;it? People are craning their necks, looking out at&nbsp;the empty spot where the Earth used to&nbsp;be. The impact of&nbsp;Mars was so&nbsp;strong that it&nbsp;pushed the Earth out of&nbsp;its orbit around the sun. It’s... gone.<br>“Great... What’re we&nbsp;going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;now?” Some bearded guy grabs a&nbsp;guitar and says: “Let’s play!”</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanecSaqa2gXZi8rbjInZydZaeewal5zJqprGWnnbaktIypo5qmlal6tMHRr6CvnaNihXJ%2FkHJvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
