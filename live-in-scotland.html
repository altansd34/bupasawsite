Emphasis of CfE is placed on inter-disciplinary learning, skills development and encouraging personal achievement and it is intended to foster four capacities in all young people:</p><ul><li><strong>successful learners</strong></li><li><strong>confident individuals</strong></li><li><strong>responsible citizens</strong></li><li><strong>effective contributors</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Nursery:</strong></p><p>Children are able to go public nursery schools in Scotland from the age of three, but private nurseries will accept children earlier than this. At the moment, Scotland currently funds up to 600 hours per year of free provision of early learning and childcare - which equates to roughly 16 hours per week in term time. However, new legislation has meant that this is due to increase up to 1,140 hours by the year 2020.</p><p><strong>Primary school:</strong></p><p>Dependent on when in the year a child's birthday falls, children will attend primary school for seven years between the ages of five and 12.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Secondary school:</strong></p><p>Dependent on when in the year a child's birthday falls, children will attend secondary&nbsp;school for up to six years between the ages of 12 and 18.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Private/Independent/Boarding schools:</strong></p><p>Throughout out the length and breadth of Scotland, there is a wide range of private/independent or boarding schools.
