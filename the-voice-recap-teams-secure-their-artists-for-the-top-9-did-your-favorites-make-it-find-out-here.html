After Monday night’s impressive performances, fans were dying to know who made it through, and who would be up for the Instant Save. For those here for the results, voted through artists are listed at the bottom of this article.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-gwen-stefani-reba-mcentire-take-the-stage>Gwen Stefani, Reba McEntire Take The Stage</h2><p>The Voice Season 24 Results Show began with Gwen Stefani performing her newest single “True Babe.” Since marrying Blake Shelton, Stefani has connected with her country roots. The couple has released multiple country tunes together, yet Stefani has returned to her pop roots with her new single. It’s said that “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">True Babe</a>” is all about Shelton, since it’s lyrics are lovingly talking about wanting to travel to someones shows, spending all their time together, and even “take[ing] the truck up the coast.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>After announcing some of the artists that were voted through by America, new coach <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reba McEntire</a> came to stage to sing her newest single “Seven Minutes in Heaven.” For fans that may remember McEntire’s recent performance on America’s Got Talent, this is not the song she performed with Sofie Dossi.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-which-artists-are-in-the-top-9>Which Artists Are in The Top 9?</h2><p>During separate portions of the show, the Top 9 was announced. The first three artists remaining in the competition are Mac Royals, BIAS, and Ruby Leigh. After a commercial break, the show’s host, Carson Daly, announced the next two artists going through, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mara Justine</a>, and Lila Forde. Following McEntire’s performance, Daly announced the next artists going through are Huntley, Jacquie Roar, and Nini Iris.</p><p>The artists performing in the Instant Save are Jordan Rainer, Kara Tenae, Tanner Massey, and Azán.</p><p>The Instant Save began with Jordan Rainer’s song, “Blame It On Your Heart” by Patty Loveless. This song was classically country, in the best way possible. Azán battled next with Ariana Grande’s “No Tears Left to Cry.” This was a fun R&B take on Grande’s hit song.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jordan Rainer has made an impact on <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> stage and in our hearts. ❤️ <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/O6owDLEnDA</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>December 6, 2023</a><p>Following a commercial break, Team Gwen member Tanner Massey took the stage, singing “More Than Words” by Extreme. Unfortunately, it seemed like Tanner’s nerves got the best of him in this performance. Last but not least came Stefani’s final Instant Save performer Kara Tenae. She came to the stage singing “Love Takes Time” by Mariah Carey. Although Kara had a few pitch slip ups in the beginning, she powerfully dominated this track.</p><p>After fan voting, Daly announced the winner of the Instant Save artist. The final artist in the Top 9 of The Voice Season 24 is Jordan Rainer.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-top-9-by-team>The Voice Top 9, By Team:</h3><p>Legend: Mac Royals and Lila Forde.</p><p>Gwen: BIAS.</p><p>Niall: Mara Justine, Huntley and Nini Iris.</p><p>Reba: Ruby Leigh, Jacquie Roar, and Jordan Rainer.</p><p>The Voice returns to NBC on Monday, December 11 for the Top 9 Live Show Performances.
