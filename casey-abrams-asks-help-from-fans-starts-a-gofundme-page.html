The ongoing recovery is a result of an almost two-month stay and three total surgeries to improve his condition.</p><p>Abrams revealed in a YouTube video that he is completely free of his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ulcerative colitis</a>, but at the cost of his colon. The surgery to remove his colon was needed to save his life, but it also left him with an expensive hospital bill.</p><p>“I could really use your support so please check out my <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GoFundMe</a>.” Abrams said. “It will help cover the costs of the medical bills, the gigs I’m not able to play, and helping out my family for taking care of me.”</p><p>All of the planned gigs that Abrams had for the year had been canceled to make way for his prolonged recovery. Even in his current state of needing financial assistance, he still gives way to help out the Crohns & Colitis Foundation. Abrams has been a member of the said foundation since 2010, and all donations on his GoFundMe that go past his specific needs will be donated to the foundation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Casey Abrams is on The Road to Recovery</h2><p>The singer is now doing better than before and is staying at home recovering from his ordeal. Although all of his future plans have taken a back seat, he remains hopeful to make new music while recovering.</p><p>“I’m regaining my strength, I’ll be spending a lot of time at home resting and hopefully creating,” Abrams said. “I’m really excited to get back out there and start playing music again and singing for all of you. I’ll be posting more updates soon.”</p><p>The GoFundMe page has a $100,000 total goal, and has currently reached almost half of that. In a couple more days the page will certainly reach the desired amount and will quite possibly even exceed it. Fans are currently wishing Abrams a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">speedy recovery</a>, so they can see their favorite performer on stage again.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_GirlNamedTom_Trae-Patton_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Girl Named Tom Hits No. 1 on iTunes After ‘The Voice’ Finale Performance" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Casey Abrams</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wpqqnrFdlq%2BzrcysZJqrm6h6qbHLqWSfqp%2BieqetzaxkrKyRp8G0ecBmnqiepaOxrrGMqZignV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
