Claims of an American origin are spread across the country, with a common them being that it was conceived by street vendors at major gatherings like amusement parks, fairs, conferences and festivals. In the American case, with a likely invention date between 1885 and 1904, the name may derive from the then-popular ‘Hamburg steak’ as the filling.</p><p>While we will probably never know the dish’s origins for sure, what do Americans and Germans themselves think?</p><p>Americans tend to believe hamburgers are a home-grown concoction, although not convincingly so, at 39%. Another 28% think they come from Germany, while 4% think they come from some other country. Three in ten (29%) are unsure.</p><p>Germans, by contrast, are happy to let America claim the dish: 55% think hamburgers come from the US. Only one in five Germans think hamburgers come from Germany (20%), while 7% think they come from another country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6aqa2hk6GytHuTbnBwaV2staa%2BxGabqGWYlrqjwdGgnKurXZi8rrE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
