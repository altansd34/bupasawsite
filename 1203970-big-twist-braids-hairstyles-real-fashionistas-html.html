They look gorgeous on every woman, no matter if you are a gentle or tough type.</p><p class=align-left>You can use some natural makeup together with this hairstyle.

Though, you can grab some inspiration from this hairstyle and use your imagination to make highlights of different coloring.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/247c7cf21a41cef2.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 amazing hairstyles with a twist – choose one for yourself</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d582ac3297d98843.jpg><h3>7. Crochet twists with the visible cornrows</h3><p class=align-left>Creativity is always welcome in any field of life, and the hairstyles are not the exception. So, instead of having the basic crochet twists, you can go with something different and innovative. The crochet twists will still be present, but the thing that makes this hairstyle so unique and outside-the-box is the addition of crochet twists with the noticeable cornrows. These twists would be a relevant hairdo no matter which event you are going to – it can be something casual, like a friendly meeting or family dinner, or something formal like the wedding or graduation. Either way, all the eyes will be on you if you add a little creative streak to the usual cornrow twists.</p><p class=align-left>Of course, you will need a hand of a master hairdresser and some pocket money for creating something so unique and magnificent, but this style will serve you for quite a long time and protect your head.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt3bc00m5e1sa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 trendy natural hairstyles for short hair</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/bb3da7613c513996.jpg><h3>8. Black and red Havana twisted bob</h3><p class=align-left>The latest trend is dying two halves of your head in different colors, like the singer Melanie Martinez did. This works very well on the African hairstyles too, and especially on the twists. The combination of black and red is a perfect balance between something usual and something daring. Besides, if you are not a big fan of long hairstyles, you could try the short bob which is an extremely fabulous choice.</p><p class=align-left>Adding this one to your list of possible hairstyles will be a great idea. It will be both attractive and protective at the same time. It is a nice compromise for those who want to have an eye-capturing hairstyle, but have no time and energy to go through all the hair maintenance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/90b721d60f49e1b9.jpg><h3>9. Medium-length twists with curls</h3><p class=align-left>Are you a fan of curly hair, but have always thought that it is impossible to create with the twists? This is just a myth which we are going to dispel right now. First of all, the ends of your hair do not always look neat when you are wearing twists. They are mostly straight and blunt edges. This hairstyle will make your twist ends look cute, gentle, and feminine.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkytgkje81u32js.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rock these smoking hot box braid hairstyles</span></p></a><p class=align-left>To reach the effect of curly edges, you could trim them a little when they are installed, or stagger your hair. Either way, this is a beautiful look which can become even better with the minimalistic accessories, clothes and makeup, to emphasize your kind and sweet nature.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3782c8e0ee100a96.jpg><h3>10. The combination of black and purple twists</h3><p class=align-left>We all want something different at some point in our life, something that will make us stand out from the dull crowd. If you are one of those people who have been wearing the crochet twists for a period of time, but recently you have desired to spice things up a little, why not add some pop of color into your twisted hair? You will not even have to dye your hair completely – just add some colorful strands which will indicate that you are a curious and creative person who loves trying something new and has a lot of different interesting hobbies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt5l56tbvil4o.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Find the perfect crochet hairstyles for your child</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is a really brave look, and purple is one of those colors which are now in trend. One of the benefits of faux hair that you add to your hairstyle is that you will not have to bleach or lighten your own locks. This will not ruin your natural hair and will give you a great unforgettable hairstyle without much effort.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Protective hairstyles for short natural hair</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/75e1242c086cb946.jpg><h3>11. Burgundy rope twists</h3><p class=align-left>Here is something for those people who want something more natural than purple, but still colorful and memorable. Burgundy is a color for those who are determined, hardworking, and fierce. Besides, it goes perfectly with the tan and dark skin of Nigerian women, as well as natural makeup. One thing that you need to know if you want to wear this hairstyle is about changing your usual makeup routine. You will have to choose the palette which will go well with your burgundy hair because the makeup supplies that you have been using with your dark hair will not give the same effect as it used to.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt1ig7h9mr3qso.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 natural hairstyles for Nigerian children</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/247c7cf21a41cef2.jpg><h3>12. Black and brown twists with the hair cuffs</h3><p class=align-left>The Nigerian women adore the hair cuffs because they are one of the most appealing accessories out of the wide range that you could use for making your hair truly shine. In combination with these natural black twists with a brown color pop here and there, the beads will surely look perfect. It is very simple to use them: you should just place them wherever you feel like they would look the best. One of the additions to this image can be your favourite earrings. Do not forget about sparkling makeup. Finally, you can use headbands, scarves and other accessories to make your look even more unique and adorable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b3eb279a7f29bf14.jpg><h3>13. Crochet bob twists</h3><p class=align-left>Are you perhaps a fan of short bobs? Good news – they are possible to make with the thick twists, just like with the thin gentle twists and cornrows. This hairstyle has a special charm to it, which will go incredibly well with your shining eyes and bright smile. Make sure you get your makeup right and add some noticeable accessories to make your look simple, sweet, but at the same time very exceptional.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt32skuum5gqg.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 15 natural hairstyles that you can wear every day</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This is one of those hairstyles for any time or occasion.

Half-up, half-down twists</h3><p class=align-left>Having a twisted hairstyle does not just mean that you have to wear them straight all the time. You can create a lot of imaginative hair options out of the twists, just like with regular natural hair. For instance, you could choose gathering your hair in half-up, half-down hairdo, which will beautifully frame your face shape and make your eyes visible. This is the hairstyle which could work both as an everyday option and something gorgeous for special events. It is not that difficult to create this hairstyle, but it will surely serve you for long and will protect you from the bad hair days.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/vllkyt4lpl3ohcpne.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>20 beautiful natural hairstyles for African women in 2018</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/dfe9f5806d5bcfda.jpg><h3>15. Half-up, half-down bun</h3><p class=align-left>This is a similar hairstyle to the previous one, but the difference is that you can gather your thick twists in the large bun on top of your head. This is a very easy and nice way to wear your twists – you only have to take some twists from the top section of your head, fix your bun on your head with some hair care supplies like grips, and let all the other hair strands loose. This works very well with crochet twists because the bun looks very grand and majestic when the twists are thick and tough. And the last thing, make sure that your makeup is on point!</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Best cornrow hairstyles for round faces</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f4dedded30e4f1a8.jpg><h3>16.

Brown and caramel twisted hairstyle</h3><p class=align-left>When you want to add some hair extensions, it will be a wise decision to try a few different colors and look at how they would be combined. If you are not keen on unnatural colorings like blues, reds or purples, and prefer something natural but at the same time appealing and classy, you can definitely turn your attention to the caramel twists.
