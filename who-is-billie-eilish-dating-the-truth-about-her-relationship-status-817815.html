Her haunting melodies and introspective lyrics have resonated with millions. But beyond the music, there was a&nbsp;secret she carried—a truth waiting to&nbsp;be&nbsp;unveiled. In&nbsp;2023, Billie Eilish stepped into the spotlight once more, this time to&nbsp;confirm what some had suspected all along: she identifies as&nbsp;queer.</p><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;candid interview with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Variety</i></a>, published on&nbsp;November&nbsp;13, 2023, Billie Eilish peeled back the layers of&nbsp;her identity. She revealed that she is&nbsp;both attracted to&nbsp;and intimidated by&nbsp;women. The publication described her struggle to&nbsp;feel like a&nbsp;«girl’s girl,» acknowledging that she has never quite related to&nbsp;girls in&nbsp;the conventional sense.</p><p>Billie’s words echoed vulnerability and authenticity as&nbsp;she confessed, «I’ve never really felt like&nbsp;I could relate to&nbsp;girls very well. I&nbsp;love them so&nbsp;much. I&nbsp;love them as&nbsp;people. I’m attracted to&nbsp;them as&nbsp;people. I’m attracted to&nbsp;them for real ... I’m physically attracted to&nbsp;them. But I’m also so&nbsp;intimidated by&nbsp;them and their beauty and their presence.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/571/786/58e9b354ee8ca75f831a546927.jpg><p>ANGELA WEISS / AFP / East News</p><p>Billie Eilish’s journey toward self-acceptance has been both private and public. Despite her Grammy-nominated anthem <i>What Was I&nbsp;Made For?</i> celebrating individual experiences with womanhood, she still grapples with her identity as&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>, «I’ve never felt like a&nbsp;woman, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest with you. I’ve never felt desirable. I’ve never felt feminine.» Even as&nbsp;she identifies with the pronouns «she/her,» Billie acknowledges that her sense of&nbsp;self doesn’t neatly fit into societal boxes. Her honesty resonates with countless others who navigate similar complexities.</p><p>Billie Eilish’s confirmation of&nbsp;her queer identity surprised some, but for others, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;validation of&nbsp;what they had sensed all along. On&nbsp;December&nbsp;2, 2023, at&nbsp;a&nbsp;red carpet event, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>playfully</a> remarked, «Wasn’t it&nbsp;obvious?» Her nonchalant response reflected both her self-assuredness and the gradual shift toward a&nbsp;more accepting world. Fans rallied around her, celebrating her authenticity and courage.</p><p>Billie’s accidental coming out—triggered by&nbsp;her candid interview—highlighted the power of&nbsp;vulnerability. She «didn’t realize» that people weren’t already aware of&nbsp;her truth. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;world where labels matter less than genuine connections, Billie Eilish’s revelation reminds&nbsp;us that authenticity transcends expectations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9ac/065/fbcf665be7b1040705d745a5c6.jpg><p>The then 21-year-old star admitted she doesn’t «<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>really believe</a>» in&nbsp;the concept of&nbsp;coming out, adding: «I&nbsp;just think, I’m just like, ‘Why can’t we&nbsp;just exist?’ I’ve been doing this for a&nbsp;long time and&nbsp;I just didn’t talk about&nbsp;it. Whoops.»</p><p>Eilish, who has not labeled her sexuality, said that when she first saw the article, she was like, «Oh, I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I came out today!»</p><p>«It’s exciting to&nbsp;me&nbsp;because&nbsp;I guess people didn’t know, but it’s cool that they know,» Eilish said. «I’m for the girls.»</p><p>In&nbsp;her November interview with Variety, Eilish talked about how she spent most of&nbsp;her life assuming that women didn’t like her.</p><p>Billie Eilish’s journey is&nbsp;a&nbsp;symphony of&nbsp;vulnerability, strength, and self-discovery. As&nbsp;she continues to&nbsp;create music that touches souls, her queer identity adds another layer to&nbsp;her artistry. So, when we&nbsp;ask, "Who is&nbsp;Billie Eilish?"—we now know that she is&nbsp;unapologetically herself, weaving her truth into every lyric and melody.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a06/61c/ba158c56b4937655250b595c55.jpg><p>In&nbsp;her November interview with Variety, Eilish discussed how she spent most of&nbsp;her life assuming that women didn’t like her. The <i>Bad Guy </i>singer explained, «I&nbsp;have deep connections with the women in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, the friends in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life, the family in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life.»</p><p>Recently, Eilish was also honored as&nbsp;a&nbsp;«changemaker» at&nbsp;Variety’s 2023 Power of&nbsp;Women event in&nbsp;Los Angeles for her work with her mother Maggie Baird’s organization, Support and Feed.</p><p>The singer was visibly choked up&nbsp;during her speech, though she blamed her emotions on&nbsp;taking the steroid prednisone to&nbsp;treat an&nbsp;illness. Eilish used her speech as&nbsp;a&nbsp;moment to&nbsp;open up&nbsp;about her feelings of&nbsp;womanhood.</p><p>«It’s really hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman out here, people,» she said. «I’ve never really felt like a&nbsp;woman, and I’ve spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;my&nbsp;life not feeling like&nbsp;I fit into being a&nbsp;woman, but&nbsp;I think for a&nbsp;few years because of&nbsp;that insecurity.»</p><p>The singer said she was «pick&nbsp;me» about gender roles when she was younger, which she now regrets, explaining that she would say things like, «Oh, I’m not like other girls.»</p><p>«I’ve grown to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very resentful of&nbsp;that period of&nbsp;time because I’m so&nbsp;much more interested in&nbsp;being like other girls because other girls are tight,» she said. «I&nbsp;love women!»</p><p>While Eilish said she still has «a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;internalized misogyny» in&nbsp;her, she added, «And I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;say, with like full transparency, I&nbsp;feel very grateful to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman right now.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a5d/4d6/c849a05a62b0ffbb0ada2e8047.jpg><p>Following the magazine’s issue in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>November 2023</a>, Eilish called out Variety in&nbsp;an&nbsp;Instagram post.
