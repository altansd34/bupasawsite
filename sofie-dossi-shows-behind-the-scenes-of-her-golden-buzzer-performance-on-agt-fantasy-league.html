The aerialist shared the moment she received an e-mail from the show up to the time she’s rehearsing in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> stage.</p><p>A few minutes into the video, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dossi</a> detailed some of her worries about joining the show again. According to the hand-balancer, she didn’t want to come back to the same stage to perform the same routine again.</p><p>“The judges have seen me do all my best tricks—literally all of them. I do not want to go back on the show and do the same thing I’ve done before. And my deadline is in like 12 hours,” she said.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Thankfully though, Dossi got inspired what her brother Zach said, that she must not feel the pressure to focus on failing.</p><p>“I got to come up with something crazier than what I’ve done before and maybe something that brings out the new me. Because I feel like I’ve grown so much since I was initially on. I was 14 years old. I need to show that somehow, even in my performance.”</p><p>After four days of brainstorming, Dossi has finally thought of “something dangerous enough to impress the judges.” Be that as it may, the contortionist struggled in making the idea feasible. From there, Dossi began making her whole vision of the performance a reality.</p><p>During her episode on AGT: Fantasy League, Dossi assured she’d bring next-level danger. Hence, dressed in a sparkly pink bodysuit, her aerial ring was set on fire as she exuded extreme grace under pressure. Doing mind-blowing flame shots while bent and up from the stage, she rightfully impressed the whole auditorium and even snatched a well-deserved Golden Buzzer for herself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-admits-that-meeting-her-rivals-freaked-her-out>She Admits That Meeting Her Rivals Freaked Her Out</h2><p>While Dossi felt confidence with her aerialist routine, she’s never one to underestimate her competitors. During the time she’s set to compete on AGT: Fantasy League, the performer confessed being nervous about other contestants.</p><p>“I was completely reminded of why I came here when my dad found a list of my competition. I’d be lying if I said it didn’t freak me out a bit,” she said. “On our way out, we ran into a person on that list, Loren Allred—an amazing singer who got a Golden Buzzer on Britain’s Got Talent and she’s even the singer on The Greatest Showman.”</p><p>Despite so, Dossi knew that there can be friendship in rivalry. As seen in the video, she’s warmed up with other contenders on the show.</p><p>“As intimidating as she and all the other acts are, the performers you meet can actually be your best friend because they understand what you’re going through,” she said.</p><p>With Klum’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Golden Buzzer</a> under her belt, Dossi is ensured a spot in the Finale.</p><p>“Not that you need it,” Klum said. “I push it for you because I love you and believe in you, and I think you’re amazing!”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/NUP_197651_00322.jpg alt="Chris Daughtry Says Singers Today Don’t Need Shows Like ‘American Idol’ to Hit Big" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qidop1dmby0v8hmqqGnp6h6o7HHoqWdZaSdsm6%2Fwp6lnqtdpLNutMSrZKCnnJmyr3nBrrGznaJivaa%2BxaipppmemLJuu81mmKCsXZuur8DArLBmpJWWtLaxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
