Gilbert emphasized their commitment, stating, “We are simply here to represent our country, our division, and that is it.”</p><p>This statement reflects their dedication to a higher purpose beyond themselves. Their mission extends beyond the confines of a talent competition stage. They aim to honor and acknowledge the support they’ve received from fellow service members and veterans. Instead, for them, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> is a platform to express gratitude and solidarity with those who have worn the uniform.</p><p>Their song choices are meaningful and purposeful. During their most recent performance, they sang “I Am Here” by Pink, dedicating it to their entire Airborne Division. In their memorable audition, they performed The Temptations’ classic “My Girl,” dedicated to the memory of Specialist Elijah Crawford.</p><p>As they prepare for the two-night <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a> finale, starting on Tuesday, September 27, the 82nd Airborne Division All-American Chorus carries aspirations of their members and the broader military community they symbolize. Their performances exude patriotism and gratitude, and their choice to prioritize charity over the cash prize underscores their dedication to a higher purpose.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-howie-mandel-salutes-the-82nd-airborne-division>Howie Mandel Salutes The 82nd Airborne Division</h2><p>During the most recent episode of AGT, fans noticed a touching moment, when Mandel stood up to applaud the chorus. Following their unique rendition of Pink’s “I Am Here.” Their powerful performance earned them not only a standing ovation from Mandel but also the entire judging panel.</p><p>Simon Cowell, the franchise creator, executive producer, and judge, joined Mandel in his appreciation. Cowell commended the group for their choice of a non-obvious song and their ability to infuse it with the perfect lyrics, making it both fun and emotive.</p><p>“I’m on my feet, and I speak for everyone here when I say thank you for your service,” Cowell said. “You are one of my favorite acts this year.”</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">82nd Airborne</a> Division All-American Chorus’ dedication to their craft and their service to the country was not lost on the judges. Sofia Vergara, Heidi Klum, and Mandel all praised their performance and thanked them for their service to the nation. Mandel, in particular, called their performance “perfect” and extended his gratitude not only for their performance but also for their dedication to the country.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_FourChairTurn_Greg-Gayne_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Recap: Premiere Features 3 Four-Chair Turns — Which Teams Did They Pick?" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKCrZp6Zo66ttdKtqmasmJp6eX7NnWSaoaKXvLO6xGaboq6ZqLawuoycn6iqpah6uLXLpWSrnZqasLV506GcZpuRqLVuvNGisZ5lmZt6tbTEsmSwoZ5itaa%2BxKxksKCpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
