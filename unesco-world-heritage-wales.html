Here, great stone structurers, including colossal blast furnaces and the remains of the giant water balance tower (which cleverly used water-filled weights to lift wagons of iron onto the adjoining tram track), loom over visitors.</p><p>A particularly popular part of the site is the award-winning <a href=#>Big Pit National Coal Museum</a>. A working mine until 1980, the museum’s clanking lifts are now loaded up with tourists rather than workmen, who are lowered 300ft underground into the town’s preserved mining tunnels. Once inside, guided tours by torchlight offer a first-hand insight into the gruelling daily routines of those who were tasked with retrieving the fuel that powered Britain’s industrial boom.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uK3Lnqpnm5%2BifLe10qKraK2emsCku4ywpquklGK1pr7IrZignV2srq2x0g%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
