Plus a&nbsp;bonus is&nbsp;waiting at&nbsp;the end because a&nbsp;certain family of&nbsp;men deserves some attention too.</p><p><h2>1. Tippi Hedren, Melanie Griffith, and Dakota Johnson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/799/f88/86e1885327be7a494e40674af9.jpg><p><a href=#>Hedren</a> was one of&nbsp;Alfred Hitchcock’s muses and most remember her for her suspenseful performance in&nbsp;Birds (1963). Her daughter Melanie followed in&nbsp;her footsteps and quickly won a&nbsp;spot in&nbsp;the sun thanks to&nbsp;her long legs and talent. One of&nbsp;Griffith’s most famous <a href=#>roles</a> to&nbsp;this day was in&nbsp;Working Girl (1988), which brought her a&nbsp;Golden Globe for Best Actress. Now, it’s Melanie’s daughter’s time to&nbsp;shine. <a href=#>Dakota Johnson</a> is&nbsp;confidently taking over Hollywood and is&nbsp;focusing on&nbsp;serious roles after concluding her work on&nbsp;the Fifty Shades series.</p><p><h2>2. Betty Witherspoon, Reese Witherspoon, and Ava Phillippe</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/919/54e/18d05954ac9a0ac26c436c4879.jpg><p>While Reese is&nbsp;the most famous one of&nbsp;the 3&nbsp;ladies, it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;just a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;time before Ava rises to&nbsp;the occasion. Betty Witherspoon, Reese’s <a href=#>mom</a>, passed down great intellect along with stunning looks to&nbsp;her girls as&nbsp;she has 3&nbsp;degrees and used to&nbsp;work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;professor of&nbsp;nursing. Reese herself is&nbsp;an&nbsp;accomplished <a href=#>actress</a> and an&nbsp;Academy <a href=# title=Award data-link=tag>Award</a> winner. As&nbsp;for Ava, she’s currently into <a href=#>photography</a> and we&nbsp;can’t wait to&nbsp;see how she turns out in&nbsp;the future.</p><p><h2>3. Galina Jovovich, Milla Jovovich, and Ever Gabo Anderson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/480/54d/0be951540faa6ee9088fa8d3a8.jpg><p>Milla’s <a href=#>mom</a> used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress, just like her daughter, when they lived in&nbsp;USSR. Her experience later allowed her to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;helpful agent for her daughter. Milla herself is&nbsp;now well-known in&nbsp;Hollywood, especially for her <a href=#>role</a> as&nbsp;Alice in&nbsp;the Resident Evil movie franchise. Galina and Milla’s talent has now passed on&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ever Gabo, who <a href=#>appeared</a> alongside her mom in&nbsp;Resident Evil: The Final Chapter (2016), and will soon be&nbsp;seen playing a&nbsp;young Natasha Romanoff in&nbsp;the upcoming Black Widow film.</p><p><h2>4. Priscilla Presley, Lisa Marie Presley, and Riley Keough</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dad/733/056efe55beb9be38babe6aa4ba.jpg><p><a href=#>Priscilla</a> started out as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and even appeared in&nbsp;3&nbsp;Naked Gun movies, but she’s currently the chairwoman of&nbsp;Elvis Presley Enterprises, a&nbsp;company that operates her late ex-husband’s tremendous legacy. Her daughter, Lisa Marie, inherited her father’s singing talent and <a href=#>released</a> 3&nbsp;studio albums. <a href=#>Riley</a>, however, is&nbsp;more like her grandmother and has also dedicated her life to&nbsp;cinema. She’s starred in&nbsp;films like Magic Mike (2012) and Logan Lucky (2017), and even received a&nbsp;Golden Globe nomination for her performance in&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV mini-series The Girlfriend Experience (2016).</p><p><h2>5. Gayle Gaston, Robin Wright, and Dylan Penn</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/790/97c/647ea55b8180586390b0bf077b.jpg><p>Interestingly, Gayle Gaston discovered her acting chops even later than her own daughter. <a href=#>Gaston</a>’s first appearance in&nbsp;films dates back to&nbsp;2011. Since then, she’s added a&nbsp;few more credits to&nbsp;her filmography and has several that have yet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;released. Her daughter <a href=#>Robin</a> has been acting since 1983 and is&nbsp;best known for The Princess Bride (1987), Wonder Woman (2017), as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series House of&nbsp;Cards, which also brought her a&nbsp;Golden Globe. As&nbsp;for <a href=#>Dylan</a>, she is&nbsp;just starting out her career in&nbsp;movies and modeling.</p><p><h2>6. Ingrid Bergman, Isabella Rossellini, and Elettra Rossellini Wiedemann</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/df6/0d1/a33d6f5bc7a436187df9787e6a.jpg><p>Swedish-born actress <a href=#>Ingrid Bergman</a> was a&nbsp;Hollywood legend with awards to&nbsp;her name like the Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA, and many others. Bergman is&nbsp;best known for her roles in&nbsp;Casablanca (1942) and <i>Spellbound</i> (1945). <a href=#>Isabella</a> was also born with a&nbsp;love for film and lent her talents to&nbsp;many films, including Blue Velvet (1986), Crime of&nbsp;the Century (1996), and Joy (2015). Unlike her grandmother and mother, <a href=#>Ellettra</a> didn’t become an&nbsp;actress and instead has chosen to&nbsp;focus on&nbsp;modeling. She’s posed for <a href=# title=Vogue data-link=tag>Vogue</a>, Harper’s Bazaar, and&nbsp;GQ, among many others.</p><p><h2>7. Nena von Schlebrügge, Uma Thurman, and Maya Hawke</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddc/842/a2810a59fea226e194a8c26fb7.jpg><p>Uma Thurman’s <a href=#>mother</a> was a&nbsp;fabulous model in&nbsp;her early years. Nena has now settled and manages Menla Mountain Retreat, a&nbsp;Tibetan resort in&nbsp;the heart of&nbsp;New York. Uma’s <a href=#>career</a> skyrocketed after she worked with Quentin Tarantino on&nbsp;the iconic movie Pulp Fiction (1994) and on&nbsp;the Kill Bill series. She’s since largely expanded her filmography and continues to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;films. Slowly, however, Thurman’s torch is&nbsp;being passed on&nbsp;to&nbsp;her daughter, <a href=#>Maya</a>, who’s already the star of&nbsp;the hit Netflix series Stranger Things and has other exciting projects in&nbsp;her future.</p><p><h2>8. Debbie Reynolds, Carrie Fisher, and Billie Lourd</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/325/0d7/f0129450e688e671f77c30a41c.jpg><p>Debbie Reynolds and her daughter Carrie were both exquisitely talented actresses. <a href=#>Reynolds</a> had roles in&nbsp;numerous films and&nbsp;TV shows and is&nbsp;also remembered for her musical gifts. <a href=#>Fisher</a> was most known for her role as&nbsp;Princess Leia in&nbsp;the Star Wars series and forever remains in&nbsp;the hearts of&nbsp;her many fans. Fisher’s daughter, <a href=#>Billie</a>, now continues her grandma’s and mom’s legacy. She also appeared in&nbsp;the new Star Wars films with her mother and is&nbsp;currently a&nbsp;cast member on&nbsp;the hit series American Horror Story.</p><p><h2>9. Blythe Danner, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Apple Martin</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/536/a3e/689dd854759a7e8d3b1b09d907.jpg><p>Academy Award winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow clearly takes after her talented mother, who also has quite the <a href=#>filmography</a> of&nbsp;her own. Blythe has appeared in&nbsp;films like 1776 (1972), The X-Files (1998), Meet the Parents (2000), and many others. <a href=#>Gwyneth</a> also found other passion and, aside from acting, she is&nbsp;the owner of&nbsp;the lifestyle company Goop, and still manages to&nbsp;shine on&nbsp;the big screen. Her daughter, Apple, has yet to&nbsp;find her calling, but considering her family background, we&nbsp;know she’s looking at&nbsp;big things for her future.</p><p><h2>10. Bebe Buell, Liv Tyler, and Lula Rose Gardner</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/054/43f/7cb96650f69b4aa7d2ea9fd1d2.jpg><p><a href=#>Liv Tyler</a> has always been destined for greatness since both of&nbsp;her parents are musical prodigies. Her mom, <a href=#>Bebe Buell</a>, was a&nbsp;famous singer and a&nbsp;fashion model with 8&nbsp;studio albums to&nbsp;her name. Liv took a&nbsp;different direction than her parents and dedicated her life to&nbsp;cinema. She’s best known for her roles in&nbsp;The Lord of&nbsp;the Rings series, Armageddon (1998), Ad&nbsp;Astra (2019), and more. Liv is&nbsp;also raising 3&nbsp;<a href=#>children</a>, one of&nbsp;whom is&nbsp;a&nbsp;girl and she’s already as&nbsp;pretty as&nbsp;a&nbsp;picture. Little Lula Rose Gardner packs a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;talent in&nbsp;her genes, so&nbsp;we’re excited to&nbsp;see what she’ll do&nbsp;in&nbsp;her life.</p><p><h2>Bonus: Stellan, Alexander, Gustaf, and Bill Skarsgård</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13c/915/a8215453e9a6c8de3bd17d824c.jpg><p>We&nbsp;couldn’t not tip our hats to&nbsp;this outstanding male family that has concentrated a&nbsp;tremendous amount of&nbsp;talent into just 2&nbsp;generations. The Skarsgårds are a&nbsp;well-known name in&nbsp;the film industry with their father <a href=#>Stellan</a> having paved the way for his sons. Out of&nbsp;his 8&nbsp;children, 3&nbsp;are already in&nbsp;high demand in&nbsp;Hollywood: <a href=#>Alexander</a> starred in&nbsp;the series True Blood and Big Little Lies, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the film The Legend of&nbsp;Tarzan (2016), among many others. <a href=#>Bill</a> is&nbsp;best-known for his role as&nbsp;Pennywise in&nbsp;the&nbsp;IT film series. <a href=#>Gustaf</a> currently stars in&nbsp;the hit show Vikings. Something tells&nbsp;us the reign of&nbsp;the Skarsgård family will continue for a&nbsp;very long time.</p><p>Which Hollywood dynasties would you like to&nbsp;know more about?
