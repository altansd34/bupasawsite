Fans were used to hearing the artist with Auto-Tune, but it turns out he has a great voice without it.</strong></p><p>T-Pain recently shared that criticism about his use of Auto-Tune, particularly from fellow musician <a href=#>Usher</a>, affected him deeply in the past. He said he suffered from depression over the comments.</p><p>In a clip from the Netflix series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">This Is Pop</a>, T-Pain shared that Usher once told him he “f‑‑‑ed up music” by using Auto-Tune in his songs. T-Pain said he gave a “nervous chuckle” in response, adding that he “didn’t understand.”</p><p>“I used it. I didn’t tell everybody else to start using it,” T-Pain said about his choice to use Auto-Tune, adding of his reaction to Usher’s comment, “That’s the very moment that started, like, a four-year depression for me.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyKk0-PL1UU</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>‘MASKED SINGER’ WINNER T-PAIN LEARNS HOW TO CHECK HIS DMS</a></strong></p><p>Usher, who was previously a coach on The Voice, has not responded to T-Pain’s newly released comments.

After winning the show in 2019, <a href=#>he told Ellen DeGeneres</a> that he expected to be eliminated in the first episode. He added that he thought he had a “real distinct voice.”</p><p>However, the judges never figured out it was him, most likely because they weren’t used to hearing him without Auto-Tune. During his time on the show, he delivered impressive performances of songs like “Stay with Me” by Sam Smith and “Don’t Stop Me Now” by Queen.</p><p>Upon winning the show, T-Pain released a surprise new album called 1UP, and later hosted the <a href=# class=broken_link>iHeartRadio Music Awards</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/NUP_194118_3912.jpeg alt="‘The Voice,’ ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Win Big at Critics Choice Real TV Awards" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>t-pain</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmaO7pr6MrWSpmZmjerSt2KxkoZ1dqMKnssSrnJ1llqe8rnnDnqernaOotrC6jKitnqpdlsK1u4ytrKedXZi%2FqsDInKCspV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
