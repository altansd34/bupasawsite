Expats often consider private schools in Germany to ensure that their children get a degree or certification equivalent to what they might receive in their home country. Some expats also think it’s important for their children to receive instruction in English or in their first language. Below, we’ll summarize the different types of schools in Germany.</p><li><a href=#>Public schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Private schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Montessori schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Alternative schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Jenaplan schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Boarding schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>International schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Rudolf Steiner schools in Germany</a></li><li><a href=#>Religious schools in Germany<br></a><a href=#>Homeschooling in Germany</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Public-schools-in-Germany>1. Public schools in Germany</h2><p>Over 11 million students attend general education and vocational <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">schools in Germany</a>, and just under 90% of them attend a state-funded public school. Education is essentially free in Germany. If you’re interested in learning more, we explain the details of the structure of primary, secondary and higher education in our <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">guide to the German school system</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Private-schools-in-Germany>2. Private schools in Germany</h2><p>Private schools in Germany are called Privatschulen or Freie Schulen, because they’re “free” in the sense of having a private, non-state school authority. However, they require state approval and can have tuition fees to help cover costs.</p><p>While the total number of schools in Germany is decreasing, private schools are on the rise. There are currently just under 6,000 private primary, secondary and vocational schools across the country, and over one million students attend a private school. The most common private schools in Germany are religious schools and Montessori or Waldorf schools.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Montessori-schools-in-Germany>3. Montessori schools in Germany</h2><p>Montessori schools in Germany follow the principles of Montessori education, based on activities and natural curiosity instead of formulaic teaching.&nbsp;</p><p>The Italian physician and educator Maria Montessori developed her method of education in the early 20th century. German Montessori schools integrate elements such as freedom of choice, blocks of uninterrupted work, prepared learning environments and teachers with Montessori training. Montessori education is more common for elementary schools, but some secondary schools employ the method.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Alternative-schools-in-Germany>4. Alternative schools in Germany</h2><p>Alternative schools are private schools under government supervision organized in the Federal Association of Free Alternative Schools (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">BFAS</a>). They typically follow concepts of reform pedagogy but are not associated with Montessori, religious or Waldorf schools.&nbsp;</p><p>Self-determination, self-organization and taking decisions <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">democratically</a> commonly play critical roles in the educational approach at these alternative schools.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Jenaplan-schools-in-Germany>5. Jenaplan schools in Germany</h2><p>The German pedagogue Peter Petersen conceived the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenaplan</a> teaching concept, named after the University of Jena. Jenaplan teaching is based on independent learning, cooperation and a sense of community beyond the classroom. This community aspect means that it involves the parents of students more heavily than some other concepts. Teaching can take place in courses, during free work by students or in some other interdisciplinary methodology. There are around a dozen <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jenaplan schools in Germany</a>.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Boarding-schools-in-Germany>6. Boarding schools in Germany</h2><p>Students attending boarding school live on the premises where they receive their formal education. There are over 250 boarding schools in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a> for most educational levels. These so-called Landschulheime base their educational approach on principles of reform pedagogy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-International-schools-in-Germany>7. International schools in Germany</h2><p>There are around 100 international schools in Germany, and many of them are English language-oriented or offer bilingual education in English and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German</a>. Depending on the school, students work towards the German Abitur to qualify for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">higher education</a>, or get an International Baccalaureate (IB), International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE) or US-equivalent High School Diploma and Advanced Placement (AP). A few international schools in Germany follow the national system of other countries, such as Switzerland, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">France</a> or Japan.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Rudolf-Steiner-schools-in-Germany>8. Rudolf Steiner schools in Germany</h2><p>Waldorf schools or Rudolf Steiner schools follow the spiritualist movement of anthroposophy and use a holistic educational style based on the philosophy of its founder, the esotericist Rudolf Steiner. His pedagogical ideas seek to foster individuality, freedom, creativity and imagination. Waldorf schools in Germany face both support and criticism.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Religious-schools-in-Germany>9. Religious schools in Germany</h2><p>Konfessionsschulen in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Germany</a> are religious or denominational schools and follow the principles of a particular faith, commonly with mandatory religious instruction. They are predominantly Christian, though Jewish and Islamic schools exist as well.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Homeschooling-in-Germany>Homeschooling in Germany</h2><p>The German education system and school laws make schooling compulsory. Depending on the federal state or <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bundesland</a>, children must attend nine or ten years of school. Compulsory schooling regulates participation, registration and choice of school; it also outlaws homeschooling. School attendance can be enforced with fines, sentences and the help of the police.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Private schools supplement the public system</h2><p>There are public and private schools in Germany. Regulations and school laws forbid homeschooling and require approval for private or alternative schools to ensure equivalence in quality and certification.&nbsp;<br>The most common types of private schools are religious, Montessori, and Rudolf Steiner schools, though other schools focusing on reform pedagogics exist. International schools with an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English-language education</a> are the focus of expats who want their children to get qualifications different from the German Abitur.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Jakob_02-1.jpg><h2>Jakob Straub</h2><p>Jakob is a freelance writer in Barcelona, Spain, and his favorite books have pages all empty.
