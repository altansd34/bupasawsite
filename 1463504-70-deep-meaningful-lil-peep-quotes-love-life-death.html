One of my favourite bands is Fall Out Boy. You put those two together, and that's Lil Peep.</li><li>I don't care what people think of me. I don't even care what happens to me.</li><li>My first year making music was very experimental. I was trying to find my sound. My second year, I was more in my element. I knew what type of production I wanted to go over and the topics I wanted to address.</li><li>I know that I am not that important to you, but to me, girl, you are so much more than gorgeous, so much more than perfect right now, I know that I am not really worth it.</li><li>And if ever need a friend then you got me and in the end, when I die, would you watch me? And if I try suicide, would you stop me? Would you help me get a grip, or would you drop me?</li><li>Living with anxiety is like being followed by a voice.

I got this homeschooling deal. I didn't have to go to school because I was depressed, and my mom wrote all these essays for me. I didn't write one of them. She literally got me my diploma.</li><li>I love gas stations. Gas stations have some of the sickest clothes ever. T-shirts, hats, everything.</li><li>Once I found out that people were really making careers for themselves off the Internet, independently, I was really inspired.</li><li>Some days, I'll be very down and out, but you won't be able to tell, really, because I don't express that side of myself on social media. That's the side of myself that I express through music.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/16bf19d6905c7dff.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Inspiring Prince quotes and lyrics about love, life and music</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>Do you have a groundbreaking story you would like us to publish?
