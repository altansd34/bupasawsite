Particularly, Joe explained that he wept when Nick was asked to be a The Voice coach.</p><p>“It was at the most picturesque setting, it was at the Fleetwood Mac show at [Madison Square Garden] and as they’re playing ‘Landslide,’ I found out that he was going to be a judge on The Voice,” Joe said. “I was so jealous I cried my eyes out to ‘Landslide.”</p><p>For those who may not know, at the time, Joe had already served as a coach in The Voice Australia. This, according to Kevin, has made them believe that Joe is more fit to be on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice USA</a>.</p><p>“It was bittersweet, of course, ’cause I’m super happy for him,” Joe said. “But I’m also bummed ’cause I want that f—ing gig!”</p><p>Be that as it may, as Joe witnessed Nick on The Voice, he supposed that Nick did a great as a The Voice coach.

According to Kevin, he also felt “some of that” when Nick and Joe pursued their solo careers after their band’s breakup.</p><p>“We always say we want someone with the last name Jonas to win. That’s our goal,” he said. “We both auditioned for the same role, Joe and I. It was for Wicked, actually. And we were going into it… and naturally, we’re brothers, we’re competitive in sports and other things, but when it comes to our career, I think we genuinely both looked at each other like…”</p><p>Joe chimed in and stated that they cheer for each other because “it’s gotta be one of us.” Furthermore, he stated that they exude this “go in there and kill it” attitude every time one attempts to try for a solo activity.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_IamTongi_OnStage_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Season 21 Winner Iam Tongi Rise to Fame, All Performances" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaicZqKfo660ecCdpKKso2K1pnnWmqpmq59it6aty6isrGWnnbKvec2imqRlnJa7pbHDZquhnV2rvKqvxGaeop9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
