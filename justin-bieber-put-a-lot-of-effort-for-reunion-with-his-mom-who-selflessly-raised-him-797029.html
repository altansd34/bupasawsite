We at Bright Side were inspired by the story of Justin’s Bieber success, which is closely connected to his mom, and we would like to share it with you.
His mom’s childhood was tough."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In&nbsp;her book <a href=#>Nowhere But&nbsp;Up</a>, <strong>she describes how cruel the world was to&nbsp;her until the age of&nbsp;15</strong>. She had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;bad people around her, so&nbsp;much so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;even felt normal. After so&nbsp;many years in&nbsp;this mess, she became quite a&nbsp;rebel teenager and even <a href=#>vandalized</a> school property.</p><p>She met Jeremy Bieber when she was 15&nbsp;and their relationship started. Soon, she left her parent’s home and feelings of&nbsp;loneliness and depression overcame her. But one year changed everything. Something happened in&nbsp;her head and she <strong>got the faith and courage to&nbsp;transform her life</strong>. She was only 17&nbsp;at that time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b4c/e5b/e4c3f15b8681780417ac3d5cd1.jpg><p>Pattie got pregnant and, in&nbsp;1994, she gave birth to&nbsp;her son <a href=#>Justin</a>. When he&nbsp;was just 2&nbsp;years old, he&nbsp;started to&nbsp;show his interest in&nbsp;music. Like a&nbsp;real mother, Mallette noticed it&nbsp;and<strong> did everything to&nbsp;encourage her son’s <a href=# title=talent data-link=tag>talent</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/505/16c/c06ce3524c869ce8d2084bd783.jpg><p>Pattie lived with Justin alone because she split up&nbsp;with her boyfriend Jeremy Bieber. In&nbsp;the documentary <a href=#>Never Say Never</a>, she opened up&nbsp;saying that it&nbsp;was obvious for her that <strong>her son needed stability and that she found that strength somewhere</strong>. It&nbsp;was challenging because Pattie was a&nbsp;teenager and she was alone. While her friends were going out and having fun, she was at&nbsp;home being a&nbsp;mother.</p><p><h2>Justin and his mom stopped talking to&nbsp;each other.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/024/1a2/16794d530888395d703c969bde.jpg><p>Justin became very popular at&nbsp;a&nbsp;very young age. As&nbsp;he&nbsp;<a href=#>confessed</a> later, saying, “I&nbsp;was letting fame destroy&nbsp;me.” He&nbsp;broke the law several times and his first <a href=#>arrest</a> was in&nbsp;2014. More than 270,000 people petitioned to&nbsp;have him deported from the United States and Bieber became distant from his mother.</p><p>He&nbsp;realized that his relationship with Pattie became “<a href=#>pretty <span><span>nonexistent.</span></span></a>” <strong>Justin was ashamed, because he&nbsp;didn’t want his mom to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disappointed </strong>in&nbsp;him and he&nbsp;knew she was."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f0d/613/687e215ef093e7911be673b27c.jpg><p>Pattie moved to&nbsp;Hawaii. The distance between her and Justin got even bigger. Bieber felt guilty for losing their connection and it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;his hands to&nbsp;fix&nbsp;it. During his concert in&nbsp;2016&nbsp;<strong>he shouted, “<a href=#>Aloha, Pattie!</a>” and publicly said that he&nbsp;loves his mom.</strong></p><p>Pattie’s reaction was immediate. She wrote on&nbsp;<a href=#>Twitter</a>: “Yes @justinbieber was a&nbsp;good boy and called to&nbsp;wish me&nbsp;Happy Mother’s Day!” And there was also another <a href=#>tweet</a> that was full of&nbsp;excitement: “Awwwwe!!! Thanks @justinbieber I&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> you so&nbsp;much, that was so&nbsp;sweet! ALOHA EVERYONE! XOXO.”</p><p><h2>Wild days are over.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/641/56b/245bdc5bebbadd3cfbb62b653e.jpg><p>It&nbsp;took time for their relationship to&nbsp;recover, but in&nbsp;2018 Pattie finally published a&nbsp;sweet <a href=#>post</a> on&nbsp;Instagram dedicated to&nbsp;her son: “<strong>Please <a href=# title=forgive data-link=tag>forgive</a> me&nbsp;of&nbsp;all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;shortcomings as&nbsp;I forgive you of&nbsp;yours, past, present, and future</strong>!! Bless you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;all you were created to&nbsp;be. What an&nbsp;honor it’s been to&nbsp;know you and watch you grow as&nbsp;your mother. We&nbsp;got this. #LoveWins.”</p><p>And love won. Pattie <a href=#>writes</a> that she is&nbsp;very “proud of&nbsp;the amazing young man” he&nbsp;is, and the young man he&nbsp;is&nbsp;becoming. She understands that no&nbsp;one is&nbsp;perfect, but she admires his character and integrity.</p><p>We&nbsp;are very happy for them and hope they continue to&nbsp;preserve this balance and harmony!</p><p>When did you say thank you to&nbsp;your parent last time? Do&nbsp;you believe that love can conquer all misunderstandings?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLe2v9OipWaamZqvpr6MqaytZZFiubDAjKidZp2Wm7yzwIyfpqtloprCr7XOp2SwoaSdeqm10makqKVdrLWwedKeo5%2BklajArcWMq5iiq5WZeqm1zGZucm9gZ4Zw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
