To talk about things we think will happen in the present or futureTo talk about our immediate decisions or actionsTo make promises or requests When to use would Would is the past tense form of will."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

You’re not the only one. Lots of non-native speakers of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English </a>are confused about using these words. Some of that confusion is because people think that would is only the past tense of will. But it has lots of other uses, so let’s have a look!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When to use will</h2><p>We use will in three main ways:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>To talk about things we think will happen in the present or future</li><li>To talk about our immediate decisions or actions</li><li>To make promises or requests</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When to use would</h2><p>Would is the past tense form of will. This is an irregular verb conjugation. Even though would is a past tense, we don’t only use it to talk about the past. Here are the main ways we use would:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>To talk about the past (OK, that one was obvious)</li><li>To be polite</li><li>In conditional sentences when we imagine something</li></ul><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">30 fun facts about the English language</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Talking about the past and the future</h3><p>When we talk about the present or the future, and things we think or believe are going to happen, we often use <strong>will</strong>.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I think I <strong>will </strong>see Donna at work tomorrow.&nbsp;</li><li>I hope I <strong>will</strong> go on holiday next year.&nbsp;</li><li>Ben <strong>won’t</strong> help me.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We use <strong>would </strong>when we talk about the past:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I thought I <strong>would </strong>see Donna at work today but she was ill.&nbsp;</li><li>I hoped I <strong>would</strong> go on holiday last year, but we didn’t have enough money.&nbsp;</li><li>Ben <strong>wouldn’t </strong>help me.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Immediate decisions and actions</h3><p>We use <strong>will</strong> when we decide to do something at the same time as we’re speaking. This is in contrast to other future tenses that we use when we made the decision earlier and we are telling someone about our plans. Here are some examples with <strong>will</strong>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Is that someone at the door? I’<strong>ll</strong> go and check.&nbsp;</li><li>I <strong>will</strong> clean up these dishes – thanks for cooking.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">When and how to use a hyphen in English</a></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Promises and requests in English</h3><p>When we make promises to someone, we use will.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I <strong>will</strong> help you move house on Friday.&nbsp;</li><li>Dad <strong>will </strong>pick you up from the pub later.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>When we are making a request, we can either use will or would. This depends on how polite we want to be; we might be polite if we’re asking someone for a really big favour, if they’re a work colleague, or if we don’t know someone that well. Look at the examples here and imagine the different contexts they are in:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Dad, <strong>will</strong> you pick me up from work later?</li><li>James, <strong>would </strong>you please drive me home from work? My car is at the mechanic.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Will </strong>you carry this for me?</li><li><strong>Would</strong> you mind helping me up the stairs with this?</li></ul><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Using would in hypothetical sentences</h3><p>We can use <strong>would</strong> to talk about something we think is unlikely to happen in the future. This can be a bit confusing for learners, because we said that would is a past tense. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">English</a>, we use past tenses to create distance between us and what we’re talking about. This might be distance in time, it might be distance in order to be polite, or it might be distance in order to say I’m imagining, or I don’t think this is going to happen. This last part is what we’re looking at now.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagining:</p><ul><li>It <strong>would</strong> be very expensive to rent a car in July.&nbsp;</li><li>Alex <strong>would</strong> make a good mother.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Swearing in English: What is really offensive?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will and would in conditionals</h2><p>There are four basic types of conditional sentences in English: zero, first, second and third. We use <strong>will </strong>in the first conditional and <strong>would</strong> in the second and third.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might expect, the first conditional talks about things we think are going to happen in the future:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If I go to Italy this year, I <strong>will</strong> stay in Rome.&nbsp;</li><li>If I eat any more of this cake, I <strong>will</strong> feel ill.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The second and third conditionals are more hypothetical, and this is why we use <strong>would</strong>. The second conditional talks about imaginary present events and unlikely future events:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If I went to Italy this year, I <strong>would</strong> stay in Rome. (The idea in this sentence is that you don’t think you will go to Italy.)</li><li>If I were a man, I <strong>would</strong> probably be taller.</li></ul><p>The third conditional talks about past events, and imagines how they could be different:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If I had gone to Italy last year, I <strong>would</strong> have stayed in Rome.&nbsp;</li><li>If I hadn’t eaten that piece of cake, I <strong>would</strong>n’t have felt ill.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Will</strong> you feel more confident using these words now? <strong>Would</strong> you like to learn more?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Laura-1.jpg><h2>Laura Jones</h2><p>Laura is a freelance writer and was an ESL teacher for eight years.
