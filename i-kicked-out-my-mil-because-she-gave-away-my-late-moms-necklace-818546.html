I’ve always gone out of&nbsp;my&nbsp;way to&nbsp;help others, and&nbsp;I take pride in&nbsp;being a&nbsp;good person. My&nbsp;husband (32M) and&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;beautiful relationship built on&nbsp;mutual <a href=# title=respect data-link=tag>respect</a> and understanding.</p><p>My&nbsp;late mother left me&nbsp;a&nbsp;precious heirloom, a&nbsp;vintage necklace that has been in&nbsp;our family for generations. It’s not just valuable, but it&nbsp;holds immense sentimental value to&nbsp;me. I’ve always kept it&nbsp;safe and only wore it&nbsp;on&nbsp;special occasions, cherishing the memories it&nbsp;holds.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e6/24c/22f465521894c2f9fc34090d25.jpg><p>Enter my&nbsp;MIL (57F), who has a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;overstepping boundaries. Despite our differences, when she lost her apartment, my&nbsp;husband and&nbsp;I opened our home to&nbsp;her, asking for nothing in&nbsp;return but basic respect for our belongings.</p><p>One day, I&nbsp;came home to&nbsp;find my&nbsp;MIL hosting a&nbsp;tea party with her friends, and to&nbsp;my&nbsp;horror, one of&nbsp;her friends was wearing my&nbsp;mother’s necklace. When I&nbsp;confronted her, my&nbsp;MIL nonchalantly said she gave it&nbsp;away because she thought it&nbsp;was ‘just old jewelry’ and that her friend admired&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6d7/ca3/8ccb4e5ea89b63b67ffdcc4095.jpg><p>I&nbsp;was heartbroken and felt utterly betrayed. My&nbsp;husband was equally appalled and supported my&nbsp;decision to&nbsp;ask her to&nbsp;leave. Now, the rest of&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;painting me&nbsp;as&nbsp;the villain, saying I’m overreacting and should <a href=# title=forgive data-link=tag>forgive</a> her because ‘family is&nbsp;family.’</p><p>I&nbsp;got the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>necklace</a> back after explaining the situation to&nbsp;MIL’s friend, but my&nbsp;MIL thinks&nbsp;I made her look extremely foolish.</p><p><h2>Redditors took the woman’s side.</h2></p><ul><li>«And how did MIL’s friend know about the necklace? Did your MIL take her on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tour of&nbsp;your bedroom, open your jewelry box, and let her root around in&nbsp;your things? Appalling overstepping and invasion of&nbsp;privacy! She should be&nbsp;shamed by&nbsp;the family, not defended and excused. Glad you got the necklace back.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>HesterFabian&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Glad you got it&nbsp;back. The only person who made your MIL look like a&nbsp;fool as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;a&nbsp;thief was herself. May I&nbsp;suggest you get an&nbsp;exterior door knob for your bedroom door that requires an&nbsp;actual key? The same for any other room you don’t want anyone roaming through. Saves a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;angst, as&nbsp;some people will paw through papers.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>3Heathens_Mom&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«She has obviously been going through your personal possessions in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;find the necklace, and there’s no&nbsp;telling what other things she has claimed for herself, or&nbsp;given to&nbsp;others.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Forward-Wear7913&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«Your MIL was completely out of&nbsp;line by&nbsp;doing this. No&nbsp;one has the right to&nbsp;give away something that isn’t theirs without the express permission of&nbsp;the owner or&nbsp;a&nbsp;person with authority over the item in&nbsp;question. Your MIL should be&nbsp;utterly ashamed of&nbsp;her behavior, not the other way around.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Betelgeuse8188&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a26/e89/808e3658b38c2297fbab98eb32.jpg><ul><li>«She gave away something that was not hers. Your home was opened to&nbsp;her on&nbsp;the condition that she respect your belongings. She broke that condition on&nbsp;many, many levels, so&nbsp;you were right to&nbsp;ask her to&nbsp;leave.<br>The rest of&nbsp;the family is&nbsp;only hearing her side of&nbsp;the story, in&nbsp;which, of&nbsp;course, she is&nbsp;painting you as&nbsp;the villain. She’s still perfectly capable of&nbsp;learning boundaries, and that actions have consequences. If&nbsp;your family members are so&nbsp;concerned, then they should be&nbsp;hosting her.<br>Quite apart from anything else, I&nbsp;would not expect a&nbsp;person to&nbsp;forgive another person for something that has happened unless&nbsp;a) that person apologizes (genuinely) for the action AND&nbsp;b) takes action to&nbsp;rectify the issue as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;possible. If&nbsp;you ‘forgive’ in&nbsp;any other situation, all you are really doing is&nbsp;condoning the action, and stating that your boundaries&nbsp;/ conditions actually have no&nbsp;meaning.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Independent_Rain4838&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«I&nbsp;can’t imagine someone being kind enough to&nbsp;let me&nbsp;stay with them, inviting friends over, and then responding by&nbsp;giving away the host’s possessions... Let alone jewelry. That’s someone who wouldn’t be&nbsp;allowed back into my&nbsp;home unless&nbsp;I was there to&nbsp;physically watch them. And even then... Maybe not.» <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chaos-n-Dissonance&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>«If&nbsp;your late mother’s jewelry is&nbsp;just ‘some random jewelry,’ then your MIL&nbsp;is just some random old lady that you don’t owe any respect and certainly not any forgiveness. What she did was malicious and so&nbsp;mean spirited&nbsp;I can’t quite wrap my&nbsp;head around&nbsp;it, I’d never want to&nbsp;see her face again.<br>Ignore the rest of&nbsp;the family, they just don’t want to&nbsp;take her in&nbsp;and have their heirlooms disappear next. As&nbsp;long as&nbsp;you and your husband are on&nbsp;the same page (which I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;happy to&nbsp;hear you are), then you can just ignore the people telling you to&nbsp;forgive.
