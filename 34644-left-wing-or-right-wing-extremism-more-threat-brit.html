For example, Labour (46%) and Lib Dem (49%) voters are twice as likely as Conservatives (22%) to see right-wing extremists as a “big threat”, while the Conservative perception of the threat posed by left-wing extremism is nearly three times greater than that of Labour voters (13%), and 19pts higher than Lib Dem supporters (17%).</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/right-and-left-wing-extremist-groups.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While a significant amount of people see these political extremists as threats, at 58% they are more likely to see Jihadists as a “big threat” – around the same proportion who said that Islamic terror groups posed in big threat in a <a href=#>similar 2019 YouGov study.</a></p><p>Approaching a quarter of Britons (24%) also see Irish Republican groups as posing a “big threat” putting them slightly ahead of left-wing extremists (23%) however is this within our margin of error.</p><p>While Conservatives see both groups as more of a threat than Labour and Lib Dem supporters, all three groups tend to see the threat posed by left-wing extremism to be around the same as that of Irish Republicans. Labour and Lib Dem voters, for their part, see the threat of right-wing extremists as being equally as serious as that of Jihadists,</p><p><strong>How should the government focus its investigation into political extremism?</strong></p><p>When it comes to the government’s investigation into political extremism in the UK, half of Britons (54%) think it should focus on both ends of the spectrum equally. Some 8% of people think that left-wing extremism should be the priority for an investigation, but twice as many (16%) think it should focus more heavily on right-wing extremism.</p><p>A majority of both Conservative voters (62%) and Lib Dem voters (60%) think the investigation should cover both groups equally, while among Labour supporters this drops to 48% in favour of looking into both equally and 33% thinking it should weigh more heavily on right-wing extremism.</p><p>* Please note that this survey was only conducted on the British mainland, i.e. in England, Scotland and Wales, and so does not include Northern Irish respondents.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnY2mDdYCMpZyfrF2stq%2BzjKipZqqZnLW1edaipaBlla3Bs7HMoqqmZZ2kv6Z506GpnpmkYq%2BztdM%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
