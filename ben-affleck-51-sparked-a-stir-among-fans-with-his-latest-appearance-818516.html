Jennifer rocked sparkly boots with jeans and a&nbsp;chic white crop top, topped with a&nbsp;stylish jacket and gold hoops. Samuel showed his Warrior’s pride in&nbsp;a&nbsp;blue Steph Curry outfit. Ben kept it&nbsp;casual in&nbsp;jeans, a&nbsp;flannel shirt, and a&nbsp;navy blue jacket, all capped off with a&nbsp;matching cap. Their outfits added to&nbsp;the fun vibe of&nbsp;the game, making it&nbsp;a&nbsp;memorable night for everyone.</p><h2>Fans took notice of&nbsp;Ben’s appearance, sparking speculation about him appearing «different».</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f6e/783/291f2659d092dc389b4098b092.jpg><p>What garnered the most attention from fans was Ben Affleck’s notably altered appearance, diverging significantly from his usual public persona. Social media was abuzz with<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#> comments</a> such&nbsp;as, «Ben Affleck is&nbsp;unrecognizable», and «Ben looks so&nbsp;different, looks nothing like him at&nbsp;all.» Someone even went to&nbsp;the extent of&nbsp;blaming Jlo for his different appearance: «Ben aged like 10&nbsp;years with Jlo.»</p><p>Many speculated that his clean-shaven face, a&nbsp;departure from his typically rugged look, was the cause of&nbsp;this drastic change. Additionally, there were discussions surrounding his uncharacteristic public smile and the genuine happiness he&nbsp;seemed to&nbsp;display while enjoying the game with his family, suggesting these factors contributed to&nbsp;his transformed appearance. Observers noted how he&nbsp;appeared genuinely pleased to&nbsp;be&nbsp;engrossed in&nbsp;the game rather than seeking attention or&nbsp;feeling uncomfortable in&nbsp;the spotlight.</p><p>Indeed, someone <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>: «Basketball is&nbsp;Ben’s happy place; that’s evident.»</p><p><h2>There were also people blaming Jennifer Lopez</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/112/5d2/1c1d9c58b48742a9acdd900076.jpg><p>He looks good to me; I've seen him in flannels lots of times; he is at a basketball game</p><p>Some folks also pointed fingers at&nbsp;Jennifer Lopez. Whenever she’s in&nbsp;the spotlight, JLo tends to&nbsp;attract criticism, and this time was no&nbsp;different. Some said she was trying too hard to&nbsp;be&nbsp;like Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck’s ex-wife, a&nbsp;critique she’s heard before. Others blamed Lopez for changing Affleck’s look and making him different from his usual self. And some thought Jennifer could have let Ben and his son have their moment without always being in&nbsp;the picture.</p><p>You know how it&nbsp;goes—people always have something to&nbsp;say, whether it’s good or&nbsp;bad. But despite all the chatter, Ben and JLo shared a&nbsp;sweet moment, as&nbsp;you can see in&nbsp;the photos from the event and the way they light up&nbsp;when they’re together.</p><p>Since reuniting, JLo and Ben Affleck have never missed an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;grab attention, and their <a href=#>marriage</a> is&nbsp;no&nbsp;secret to&nbsp;anyone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2BmuoyanZ%2BklZi4boGQZqqpmaKgsqV5wGaqraGiYq6uu82gZJ%2BZnqh6uLXToWShoaNiuaLAxKyrZpmgpbKivsCnmp5laGaFdn2VaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
