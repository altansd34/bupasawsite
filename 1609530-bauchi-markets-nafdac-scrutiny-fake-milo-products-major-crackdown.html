The scale of challenge of counterfeiting is alarming. But it is still their primary responsibility to address it. I would advise for an expansion of the manpower at NAFDAC, as well as more investment in technology and other operational resources for the personnel. Also, other agencies with responsibility to check counterfeit products can collaborate with NAFDAC to improve the situation. The Customs is a primary stakeholder in this respect. The police as well. Preventing fake products from entering the country, and prosecuting criminals who engage in counterfeiting and smuggling of such products should be decisively done. Finally, citizens have to help NAFDAC. If you see counterfeiting anywhere, sound the alarm; so much is at stake.”<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/ac8519c197d7aa2c.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>NAFDAC intercepts 3 fuel tankers used to transport vegetable oil in Lagos, video trends</span></p></a><h2>NAFDAC warns Nigerians about ginny non-dairy creamer</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that NAFDAC also <a href=#>issued a public alert</a> regarding the illegal distribution of falsified Ginny non-dairy creamer products.</p><p class=align-left>The agency said the counterfeit products have flooded markets across the country, particularly in northern Nigeria, due to their high demand.</p><p class=align-left><i>Proofreading by James, Ojo Adakole, journalist and copy editor at Legit.ng.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdku6qzxKugmmdha316gZJpZJuZpZi1qnnMmqmknaSoeq%2BtxZ2YnGWjmL%2B2wMinsGaekaCybrnIpaZmqKKksbav06xkppmapL9ur9GamqScn6y7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
