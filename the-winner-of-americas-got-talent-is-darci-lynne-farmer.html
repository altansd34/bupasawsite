All of these months, tons of acts, lots of amazing stories later, and we are at the finale of America’s Got Talent season 12. 52 million people voted, the most in the history of AGT. Tonight we find out which of the ten acts we saw perform yesterday will walk away with a million dollars and a headline gig at a Las Vegas show."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Makes sense. Kelly started out right where they are on that other singing competition show.</p><p>Then the two performance art dance groups, Diavolo and Light Balance, both did their thing showing off some ridiculous moves and jumped through a giant wiffle ball and whatnot. They may not win, but both are getting their own shows in Vegas. No doubt.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Mandy Harvey performed with the one and only Shania Twain. It’s the kind of performance that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Then there was a super creepy video where Darci Lynne Farmer’s puppet Petunia and Jeff Dunham’s old guy puppet came to life. Presumedly to murder. Then Darci Lynne performed with Terry Fator. It was a meeting of the three most famous ventriloquists in the world.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Then Chase Goehring and Evie Clair sang with James Arthur. It was seriously lovely.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>It finally came time to pick the top five. First up was Chase Goehring and Mandy Harvey. Not surprisingly, Mandy got the spot. Next up was Sara Carson and Hero vs. Evie Clair. In a bit of an upset, Sara was chosen over Evie. Diavolo and Light Balance squared off for the next spot. Light Balance got the votes so they advanced. Preacher Lawson and Darci Lynne Farmer were up next and, as comes as a surprise to no one, Darci Lynne got the spot. Finally, we have Angelica Hale and Kechi. Again, no surprise, Angelica got the votes.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Then they whittled down the last five. First to go was Sara and Hero. She’s great and I’m sure she’ll do great with her pups. Next to go was Mandy Harvey. I’m kind of shocked Mandy lost over Light Balance. Of course, Light Balance was the next to go. It finally came down to the two we knew it would come down to: Angelica Hale and Darci Lynne.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>And finally…the winner is…(dramatic pause)…</p><p>Darci Lynne Farmer!</p><p>I was SURE that Angelica was going to pull it out after the last week. Wow. America loves puppets.</p><p>What an amazing season!</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/americas-got-talent-2017-finale-darci-lynne-farmer-angelica-hale-620x360.jpg alt="‘America’s Got Talent’ Gets The Most Votes Ever" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq%2BZo7umvoyonWaZnZq%2Fqq%2FArGSgp6RiwaK4xKerZqGjYrGivsKiZKWxnqOybrLAq6Seql8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
