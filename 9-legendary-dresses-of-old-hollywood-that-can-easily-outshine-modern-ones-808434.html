The gorgeous outfits were usually created by&nbsp;designers of&nbsp;movie companies who stayed in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;fashion like world-famous couturiers. Every one of&nbsp;these dresses hides a&nbsp;big story, and they even have their own secrets.</p><p>We&nbsp;at<strong>&nbsp;Bright Side</strong> collected famous dresses of&nbsp;the actresses of&nbsp;Hollywood’s Golden Age that people still talk about with admiration.</p><p><h2>Vivien Leigh, <i>Gone With the Wind</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c10/32b/e2d3b4509fa2a07bf5fb025a1e.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the cult classic, <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, Vivien Leigh’s character shows up&nbsp;at&nbsp;Ashley Wilkes’ <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>birthday</a> in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tight dress with a&nbsp;deep neckline decorated with ostrich feathers. The dress was created by&nbsp;the costume designer, Walter Plunkett. As&nbsp;the story goes, the dress was picked up&nbsp;by&nbsp;Scarlett’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spouse</a>, Rhett Butler. Having learned she had warm feelings for another man, he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;put her in&nbsp;a&nbsp;confusing situation.</p><p>As&nbsp;curious as&nbsp;it&nbsp;might sound, before the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>celebration</a> of&nbsp;the seventy-fifth anniversary of&nbsp;the film, Scarlett’s defiant dark red dress ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the hands of&nbsp;restorers because its hem was torn. They immediately understood what the issue was and what was stretching the fabric of&nbsp;the dress. Using an&nbsp;ultrasonic machine, tweezers, and scissors, they removed lead weights from the back of&nbsp;the dress. The weights were then transferred to&nbsp;specially made sections, which are supposed to&nbsp;keep the fabric intact, continuing to&nbsp;hold the weights. Thanks to&nbsp;this alteration, the dress was saved from destruction.</p><p><h2>Elizabeth Taylor, <i>A&nbsp;Place in&nbsp;the Sun</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5fb/e3f/3c8c455b359300945b6b8acaa2.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the movie,<i> A&nbsp;Place in&nbsp;the Sun</i>,<i> </i><a href=# title="Elizabeth Taylor" data-link=tag>Elizabeth Taylor</a> played Angela Vickers. And though the executives of&nbsp;the film company doubted casting the young actress for the lead role, the director insisted on&nbsp;his decision to&nbsp;film Elizabeth. The famous Edith Head was the costume designer. “Elizabeth prided herself on&nbsp;her tiny waist and was always willing to&nbsp;wear her gowns very tight to&nbsp;achieve a&nbsp;waspish look. I&nbsp;can still hear her telling&nbsp;me, ‘Tighter, Miss Head, tighter,’” Edith recalls.</p><p>In&nbsp;order to&nbsp;promote the flick, they held a&nbsp;contest where the winner would get to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prom</a>, accompanied by&nbsp;Elizabeth Taylor, wearing the very dress by&nbsp;Edith Head. In&nbsp;1952, the movie won an&nbsp;Oscar for Best Costume Design.</p><p><h2>Barbra Streisand,<i> Hello, Dolly!</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5ac/346/20d034530f982e39bc345ac8d4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the movie,<i> Hello, Dolly!, </i>Barbra Streisand appears in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dress that is&nbsp;believed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the “most <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expensive</a> dresses ever made for a&nbsp;film.” The luxury golden dress covered with Swarovski crystals weighed 40&nbsp;pounds. That made the crew worry that the actress wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;perform the dance, which is&nbsp;why they decided to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rehearsal</a> first.</p><p>Barbra tripped over the hem of&nbsp;her dress twice and was stepped on&nbsp;two times by&nbsp;the dancers. Then they called in&nbsp;Irene Sharaff, the costume designer, for help. However, after watching the scene from beginning to&nbsp;end, she said, “Perhaps if&nbsp;you changed the movements, the dancers wouldn’t step on&nbsp;the dress. Moreover, I&nbsp;don’t think Barbra will be&nbsp;tripping on&nbsp;the dress when it’s finished. And if&nbsp;the dress doesn’t work, there will be&nbsp;some changes made.” Eventually, the scene with the dress turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;flawless.</p><p><h2>Audrey Hepburn, <i>Roman Holiday</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c70/ee1/8265d35932aaac10e957ac3fc3.jpg><p>Taking part in&nbsp;the <i>Roman Holiday</i> turned Audrey Hepburn into a&nbsp;style icon&nbsp;— she changed the standards of&nbsp;beauty. In&nbsp;many ways, this is&nbsp;due to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>designer</a> Edith Head, who created outfits for the famous film. Before the appearance of&nbsp;the “fragile actress” in&nbsp;the Hollywood elite, many girls wanted to&nbsp;look like curvy divas but stopped following the imposed ideals and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adding</a> cotton to&nbsp;their bras.</p><p>Later, the designer <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>redesigned</a> the dress in&nbsp;which Audrey’s character, Princess Ann, appears in&nbsp;the last scene so&nbsp;that the actress could do&nbsp;it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Academy Awards.</p><p><h2>Rita Hayworth, <i>Gilda</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3cf/f5b/57e43e58568072120d6497753d.jpg><p>The scene from the noir film, <i>Gilda</i>,<i> </i>where Rita Hayworth sings a&nbsp;song in&nbsp;a&nbsp;tight black dress, is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>deemed</a> one of&nbsp;the top 10&nbsp;best moments in&nbsp;the history of&nbsp;movie fashion. It&nbsp;was the Hollywood costume designer, Jean Louis, who created&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;was inspired by&nbsp;the <a href=# title=painting data-link=tag>painting</a>, <i>Madame X</i>. The character’s image was complemented by&nbsp;long gloves made of&nbsp;the same material, satin.</p><p>The filming took place a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months after Rita had a&nbsp;daughter, which is&nbsp;why she had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;corset. Moreover, in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;make the upper part of&nbsp;the dress retain its shape, it&nbsp;was made of&nbsp;soft <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>plastic</a>.</p><p><h2>Grace Kelly, <i>Rear Window</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/232/906/4303e95234b1ffdc7032cbc5f0.jpg><p>According to&nbsp;the storyline of&nbsp;Alfred Hitchcock’s<i> Rear Window</i>, the protagonist wakes up&nbsp;a&nbsp;second before <a href=# title="Grace Kelly" data-link=tag>Grace Kelly</a>’s character kisses him. The girl has just arrived from Paris and is&nbsp;wearing a&nbsp;gorgeous dress with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>black</a> bodice and a&nbsp;mid-calf full skirt with a&nbsp;spray bunch pattern on&nbsp;the hip area. This dress is&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>considered</a> one of&nbsp;the most copied of&nbsp;Grace Kelly’s outfits.</p><p>The director wanted it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;immediately clear that she was a&nbsp;rich lady from high society. Perhaps that’s why he&nbsp;invited Edith Head to&nbsp;create the dress. By&nbsp;that time, the designer had already won 5&nbsp;Oscars for Best Costume. By&nbsp;the way, she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> also Grace Kelly’s friend.</p><p><h2>Jane Russell, <i>The Revolt of&nbsp;Mamie Stover</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/806/0b1/9a5f2c564d92ef39098201699a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the movie, <i>The Revolt of&nbsp;Mamie Stover</i>, of&nbsp;the year 1956, Jane Russell <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>appears</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;emerald-green dress woven with gold thread and a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;glittering beads, designed by&nbsp;William Travilla.</p><p>It’s quite interesting that the costume designer managed to&nbsp;save funds while creating this piece, simply because the dress was meant for a&nbsp;different role, Jane, in&nbsp;the movie, <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>,<i> </i>which had been released 3&nbsp;years earlier. However, at&nbsp;that time, the scene with the dress had been cut from the flick.</p><p><h2>Lauren Bacall, <i>To&nbsp;Have and Have Not</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/db5/7a0/95f77a57a7a6f73976ccd85dcd.jpg><p>The black silk dress Lauren Bacall’s character wears in&nbsp;<i>To&nbsp;Have and Have Not </i>(1944) consists of&nbsp;2&nbsp;parts: an&nbsp;elegant top with wide shoulders and a&nbsp;draped skirt connected by&nbsp;a&nbsp;large belly ring. The image is&nbsp;complemented by&nbsp;black shoes with an&nbsp;open toe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/baa/9ff/9fa5af5968bcc2fa495d678b9f.jpg><p>The cult green dress by&nbsp;Versace, which was famously worn by&nbsp;J.Lo, can be&nbsp;considered a&nbsp;descendant of&nbsp;the dress worn by&nbsp;Lauren Bacall. The singer shocked everyone at&nbsp;the Grammy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Award</a> ceremony in&nbsp;2000 and has donned dresses of&nbsp;a&nbsp;similar cut many times at&nbsp;her concerts and public events. The dress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>created</a> by&nbsp;Milo Anderson had a&nbsp;big <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>effect</a> on&nbsp;modern design.</p><p><h2>Marilyn Monroe, <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/818/96b/0bc1a4548b8d315559df134884.jpg><p>The memorable music number from <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i>, starring one of&nbsp;the main actresses of&nbsp;Hollywood’s Golden Age, Marilyn Monroe, is&nbsp;still copied by&nbsp;modern celebs. The dress was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>created</a> by&nbsp;William Travilla who had a&nbsp;short affair with Marilyn. Since the diva thought that a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>full</a> skirt made her look plumper, the costume designer took her desires into consideration and created a&nbsp;narrower dress just for her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d30/724/031b2a5680b4d0e393d670ef65.jpg><p>Initially, the dress was supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;different and in&nbsp;a&nbsp;black hue, however, they had to&nbsp;replace it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the very last moment because the studio found the outfit to&nbsp;be&nbsp;too defiant. The talented designer not only managed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replace</a> the dress by&nbsp;making it&nbsp;pink, but they also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>created</a> the second one so&nbsp;that the actress could alternate them because it&nbsp;would get dirty during filming.</p><p>Moreover, Travilla faced another issue&nbsp;— the material was so&nbsp;slippery that the dress would drop off of&nbsp;Marilyn with every move she made. Then the designer came up&nbsp;with the idea of&nbsp;gluing the silk fabric on&nbsp;felt and adding a&nbsp;lining at&nbsp;the back to&nbsp;stiffen&nbsp;it. By&nbsp;the way, the huge bow on&nbsp;the back is&nbsp;part of&nbsp;the design, not a&nbsp;separate detail. The funny thing&nbsp;is, the gems on&nbsp;the actress were fake when she was performing the song, “<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Diamonds Are a&nbsp;Girl’s Best Friend</a>.”</p><p>What other famous dresses from movies and&nbsp;TV shows can you recall?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuuMSgnKeckafGbrDRnqqsnaNivKd5zqWbZqCfobm6w86om2asmJbBbq%2FAp2SemaOeubp5zq6rrKCZo7Juuc6dnKumXaS7pr%2BMcWdxbGNpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
