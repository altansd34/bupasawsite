Here’s how everything played out.
Yesterday was my birthday, and my husband decided to have a BBQ with his best friend, Matt, and Matt’s girlfriend, Jane, who is pregnant. Matt and Jane live just two houses away from us. It was a small gathering with just us, our three kids, and them with their three kids."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Matt and Jane live just two houses away from&nbsp;us. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;small gathering with just&nbsp;us, our three kids, and them with their three kids.</p><p>I&nbsp;bought about <strong>$90 worth of&nbsp;hamburgers and hotdogs</strong> for the BBQ. Matt also brought over 2&nbsp;lbs of&nbsp;hamburger meat. While the guys were grilling, I&nbsp;took all the kids swimming in&nbsp;our pond. Jane sat with the guys while they <a href=# title=cooked data-link=tag>cooked</a>, mostly on&nbsp;her phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ffc/592/a878935a1694443952e9ec3772.jpg><p>Around&nbsp;5:30, the guys called the kids over for food. My&nbsp;middle child, who is&nbsp;9, and&nbsp;I weren’t hungry yet, so&nbsp;<strong>we&nbsp;stayed in&nbsp;the water swimming</strong> on&nbsp;our tubes for an&nbsp;extra 40&nbsp;minutes or&nbsp;so. I&nbsp;wasn’t paying much attention to&nbsp;what was happening near the grill.</p><p>By&nbsp;6:15, my&nbsp;husband mentioned he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;run to&nbsp;the store, so&nbsp;I suggested to&nbsp;my&nbsp;son that we&nbsp;should eat now. By&nbsp;the time we&nbsp;got up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the grill, both my&nbsp;husband and Matt had left, and so&nbsp;had Jane. When we&nbsp;reached the grill, we&nbsp;found that <strong>all the food was gone&nbsp;— every bit of&nbsp;it</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/788/141/4b09b05b529129011d21e4c70a.jpg><p>I&nbsp;called my&nbsp;husband and asked him where all the food went, and he&nbsp;said it&nbsp;should still be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the grill. I&nbsp;explained that everything had disappeared. There was a&nbsp;long silence before he&nbsp;admitted, “<strong>Jane asked if&nbsp;she could take some leftovers</strong>, but&nbsp;I didn’t think she’d take it&nbsp;all.” He&nbsp;mentioned there were at&nbsp;least 8&nbsp;burgers, 10&nbsp;hot dogs, and macaroni salad left when he&nbsp;left for the store just 10&nbsp;minutes earlier.</p><p>I&nbsp;asked him to&nbsp;call Matt and find out what happened to&nbsp;the food. After he&nbsp;spoke with Matt, he&nbsp;called me&nbsp;back and said Matt claimed Jane only took “a&nbsp;few things” and that they were already eaten. But my&nbsp;oldest son, who is&nbsp;13, bluntly told me&nbsp;he&nbsp;<strong>saw Jane leave our property carrying the entire large foil BBQ dish</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b7/8d8/55a9eb55dabaa17bf0103f77cf.jpg><p>I&nbsp;was upset by&nbsp;then. Neither my&nbsp;son nor&nbsp;I had eaten anything, and my&nbsp;husband was annoyed too, but he&nbsp;just grabbed something for&nbsp;us from the store instead of&nbsp;making a&nbsp;scene. I&nbsp;didn’t blame him, considering he&nbsp;and Matt work together.</p><p>To&nbsp;my&nbsp;surprise, Jane and her kids <strong>returned over 45&nbsp;minutes later and asked if&nbsp;they could have some cake</strong>. I&nbsp;told Jane her kids could, but not her. When she asked why, I&nbsp;said, “I’m pretty sure you’ve eaten enough, considering you took off with my&nbsp;entire BBQ dinner before my&nbsp;son and&nbsp;I could even have a&nbsp;bite.”</p><p>She tried to&nbsp;argue that my&nbsp;husband said she could have&nbsp;it, that <strong>“half of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was hers” because they brought 2&nbsp;lbs of&nbsp;hamburger meat</strong>, and she “didn’t realize” my&nbsp;son and&nbsp;I hadn’t eaten yet (even though she was right next to&nbsp;the grill the whole time). I&nbsp;just shrugged and walked away. She told her kids, “Let’s go,” and they left without any cake. At&nbsp;that moment, I&nbsp;started feeling like maybe&nbsp;I had overreacted. No&nbsp;one has mentioned anything since, but&nbsp;I can feel the tension.</p><p><h2>Others supported her.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/70b/b0b/f13f885954a0215d07cae2db1f.jpg><ul><li>“I’ve never even <i>asked</i> a&nbsp;host if&nbsp;I could take leftovers. It&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;that anything you brought to&nbsp;contribute to&nbsp;the party was up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the discretion of&nbsp;the host to&nbsp;dole out afterward, and in&nbsp;some ways, a&nbsp;thank you to&nbsp;the host for letting their home and equipment be&nbsp;used. The host would generally offer back unused items, or&nbsp;that had a&nbsp;significant amount left over. Many hosts would package up&nbsp;leftovers, but it&nbsp;was always small amounts—a little taste of&nbsp;whatever had a&nbsp;lot left.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>HappyLucyD&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“She probably could have taken half of&nbsp;what was there, and you wouldn’t have noticed.
