They are more likely to get involved in social activism concerning issues like race equality, civic engagement and climate change. Whether they’re advocating on social media platforms or public protests, one thing is for sure:</span> <i><span>they don’t want brands to remain silent.</span></i></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><b>Eighty-four percent of Gen Z adults</b></a><b> expect CEOs to speak out on issues of political, social, or cultural importance.</b></p><p><span>Publicizing what your brand is doing regarding these social issues is a beneficial way to get on the youngest generation of adults’ good side.</span></p><h3 id=gen-zs-favorite-social-media-platforms><strong>Target Gen Z’s favorite social media platforms</strong></h3><p><span>Gen Z adults are the first digital natives, born between 1997 and 2004 into a world of vast technological advances and innovations. They are unlike other generations that either grew up without or came into adulthood during the rise of social media, smartphones and instant accessibility of information.</span></p><p><b>Your brand’s Gen Z marketing strategies should center around the social platforms that the generation loves most.</b><span> Platforms like TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram are all favorites of the online generation. Brands that engage well on these channels stand a better chance of earning their favor. For instance, our data suggests that people who scroll TikTok several times a day have a </span><a href=#><span>more favorable impression of Crocs</span></a><span> than those who aren’t scrolling (</span><b>58% versus 40%</b><span>).</span></p><p><span>If your brand doesn’t have a large social following, that’s okay. To help lesser-known brands get in front of the right audiences, Meta is </span><a href=#><span>boosting content discoverability</span></a><span> across Instagram and Facebook: Mark Zuckerberg said in July that while roughly 15% of Instagram feeds currently include content from accounts users don’t follow, that number should double by the end of 2023, according to </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>Meta’s Q2 2022 earnings call transcript</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/10/31105742/brands-newsletter-desktop-wide-v2.png alt="Brand insights newsletter subscription" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></span></p><h3 id=video-marketing><strong>Incorporate video marketing into your campaigns</strong></h3><p><a href=#><span>Eighty-six percent of Gen Z adults</span></a><span> have a favorable impression of YouTube, making it the most popular brand among the cohort. This means that the most effective marketing campaigns for enticing Gen Z include video content.</span></p><p><span>For instance, platforms such as TikTok and Youtube Shorts specialize in short-form video content. These bite-sized videos are just long enough to keep viewers’ attention, while also leaving room for questions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>For your brand’s marketing strategies, consider creating short-form videos for platforms like Youtube, TikTok and Instagram to generate more leads among Gen Z users.</span></p><h3 id=influencer-marketing><strong>Boost awareness and brand credibility through influencer marketing</strong></h3><p><span>An influencer is someone in your industry with sway over your target audience. Influencers have specialized knowledge, authority or insight into a specific area of interest. Their preexisting presence in a niche makes them a useful launching pad for brands seeking credibility.</span></p><p><span>Before social media, the main type of influencers were celebrities. Today, industry experts, content creators and individuals with a highly engaged social media following can all be influencers. Partnering with an influencer in your upcoming marketing campaign can help boost awareness and brand credibility, especially with Gen Z.</span></p><h3 id=experience-marketing><strong>Reach Gen Z with experience marketing</strong></h3><p><span>Marketing to Gen Z doesn’t have to be complicated. Many of the trusted marketing strategies that have worked in the past for other generations also work for Gen Z. One prime example of this is experience marketing.</span></p><p><span>According to </span><a href=# rel=noopener><span>an industry report by Event Marketer and Mosaic</span></a><span>, about 91% of consumers tend to have positive feelings about a brand after attending a branded experience or event.</span></p><p><span>As people begin to return to in-office environments, planning in-person events for prospects is an excellent way to reach your Gen Z audience.</span></p><p><a href=#><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/10/31114607/Most-Trusted-Brands-2022-Report-Desktop-Wide-1.png alt="Morning Consult Most Trusted Brands 2022: Report Download" width=1800 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><h3 id=learn-from-other-brands><strong>Learn from brands that resonate with Gen Z</strong></h3><p><span>What better way to learn how to market to Gen Z than by examining the brands favored by the generation? </span><b>Our recent report, </b><a href=#><b>Gen Z’s Favorite Brands</b></a><b>, ranks the companies that are most successfully winning over the youngest generation of adults.</b></p><p><span>Ranking at number 5 on Morning Consult’s list of Gen Z’s Favorite Brands is M&Ms, with 80% favorability among the cohort.
