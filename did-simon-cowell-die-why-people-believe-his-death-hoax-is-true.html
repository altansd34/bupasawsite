Despite being repeatedly debunked, some hoaxes survive and reemerge from time to time. This is most likely due to the fact that the public is still vulnerable to disinformation and fake news, particularly when it is spread and amplified by social media algorithms.</p><p>For those who may not know, a death hoax is a fake report or claims about the death of a well-known person. In Cowell’s case, fake rumors of his death have circulated on social media and the internet on multiple occasions. The hoaxes are typically spread by malicious individuals or organizations with the purpose to cause confusion.</p><p>One celebrity who fell for these hoaxes is Cowell’s ex-girlfriend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sinitta</a>. They were romantically involved with each other in the 80s. The singer took to Instagram to write her reaction to the hoaxes. She was obviously upset and distressed when people started messaging her about the fake news.</p><p>People agree with Sinitta’s post that death hoaxes are no joke, and should not be taken seriously by the readers. She then went on to confirm that Cowell is very much alive and well, and that the false claims should be stopped.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Is Simon Cowell’s Death Hoax About?</h2><p>Cowell’s death hoaxes are rumors that are misleading and deceptive and have no basis in truth. They are intended to cause the spread of misinformation and should not be taken seriously. Some of the hoaxes detail that the AGT judge passed away from an apparent heart attack.</p><p>These hoaxes however, have been repeatedly exposed, and Cowell himself has frequently used social media to debunk the claims. He told his admirers that he is still very much alive and well. It’s always advisable to double-check with reputable sources if you come across any news or information that sounds suspicious or unconfirmed before sharing it with others.</p><p>Numerous people have recently published news stories on social media saying that well-known celebrities like Alan Jackson, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kelly Clarkson</a>, and even Elliott Davis had passed away. The most recent famous person to fall for one of these scams is Cowell.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Original_BrandonLeake_Casey-DurkinNBC-220x147.jpg alt="Meet Brandon Leake, The One of a Kind ‘AGT’ Winner Competing in ‘AGT All-Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w6KbZquZoryvecKorp6knGKxqrGMsJ%2ByZaCavLG4xGaZnqSZmsOmeceiqmaclZbBqXnHqJixZZmoerW%2B1J5m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
