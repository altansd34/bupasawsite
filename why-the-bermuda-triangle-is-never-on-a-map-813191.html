Can we&nbsp;estimate how many ships and airplanes were lost in&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle? Have their disappearances resulted from human error or&nbsp;weather phenomena? Let’s try to&nbsp;find out. We&nbsp;have a&nbsp;curious story of&nbsp;the S.S. Cotopaxi. This ship vanished in&nbsp;1925, traveling from Charleston, South Carolina, to&nbsp;Havana. It&nbsp;never reached its destination. Years later, in&nbsp;the 1980s, a&nbsp;wreck was found 40&nbsp;mi off St. Augustine, Florida. Since specialists could not precisely determine what and where it&nbsp;came from, they nicknamed it&nbsp;“Bear Wreck”. It&nbsp;took many additional years of&nbsp;work, done mainly by&nbsp;marine biologists, to&nbsp;identify that this ship was indeed the missing S.S. Cotopaxi. This was confirmed in&nbsp;January 2020. How did the ship just reappear? And how did it&nbsp;get there, since this mysterious shipwreck isn’t even in&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e9e/ce6/2898645af4b3b55401d3ae30bc.png><p>Let’s see who came up&nbsp;with this term, “Bermuda Triangle”. Can you actually pinpoint the triangle on&nbsp;a&nbsp;map? No, it’s not an&nbsp;officially recognized location either. The Bermuda Triangle does not appear on&nbsp;any world map. Nobody has agreed on&nbsp;its exact boundaries. There are only assumptions with approximations of&nbsp;the entire area ranging between 500,000 and 1.5 million square miles. By&nbsp;all approximations, the region has a&nbsp;vaguely triangular shape. In&nbsp;1964&nbsp;an American author named Vincent Hayes Gaddis first came up&nbsp;with the idea when writing an&nbsp;article for Argosy magazine. He&nbsp;used the Bermuda Triangle to&nbsp;describe a&nbsp;triangular region “that has destroyed hundreds of&nbsp;ships and planes without a&nbsp;trace.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7b0/dba/c80d715d6389fd975b6d038c62.png><p>It&nbsp;is&nbsp;pretty hard to&nbsp;get the number of&nbsp;lost ships and planes because some ships and aircraft have gone missing without leaving a&nbsp;trace. Their wreckage in&nbsp;the region has not been recovered. But the recorded stories should help&nbsp;us. Legends about the Bermuda Triangle date back to&nbsp;the 15th century. Like that of&nbsp;the Italian explorer Christopher Columbus. When sailing through the Atlantic waters, he&nbsp;passed by&nbsp;this location in&nbsp;the late 1400s. In&nbsp;what we&nbsp;now know as&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle, he&nbsp;saw a&nbsp;huge flame that seemed to&nbsp;just crash into the ocean. Later, he&nbsp;saw an&nbsp;unusual light flashing in&nbsp;the distance at&nbsp;the exact location. Like many other sailors since then, his compass had severe malfunctions. Flight&nbsp;19: a&nbsp;navy plane on&nbsp;a&nbsp;routine schedule back in&nbsp;1945 also started the Bermuda Triangle legend.</p><p>It&nbsp;was commanded by&nbsp;Lieutenant Charles Taylor, and it’s recorded that he&nbsp;just got lost in&nbsp;the triangle for no&nbsp;reason. Since pilots had no&nbsp;GPS back then, they had to&nbsp;trust their compasses and keep track of&nbsp;how long they’d been flying in&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific direction and their speed. Shortly after completing the task, both of&nbsp;the compasses onboard stopped working correctly. Records found after the plane’s disappearance also indicate that Taylor didn’t have a&nbsp;watch on&nbsp;that particular day. The initial report stated that pilot error was to&nbsp;blame for this unfortunate event. However, because people weren’t satisfied with this outcome, it&nbsp;was changed to&nbsp;“causes or&nbsp;reasons unknown after several reviews.” One surviving pilot named Bruce Gernon suggested he&nbsp;went through an&nbsp;electronic fog while passing above the triangle, making him travel through time!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/97f/96f/5f17df534ca282538f3a6930b8.png><p>In&nbsp;1970, when this incident happened, he&nbsp;was flying his aircraft when it&nbsp;was surrounded by&nbsp;two huge clouds that formed a&nbsp;whirlpool and spiraled. Like many others before him, he&nbsp;noticed that his navigation devices were malfunctioning. When he&nbsp;eventually made it&nbsp;out of&nbsp;those clouds, he&nbsp;discovered that his flight had only taken 35&nbsp;minutes. It&nbsp;should have taken 75&nbsp;in&nbsp;total. Since he&nbsp;had no&nbsp;other reasonable explanation for what he&nbsp;went through, he&nbsp;believed he&nbsp;must have been pushed forward in&nbsp;time. It’s not only strange-looking clouds that have been seen above the Bermuda Triangle. In&nbsp;2014, a&nbsp;pilot recalled almost colliding with a&nbsp;flying object that he&nbsp;could not identify whatsoever! Some of&nbsp;these strange encounters were even caught on&nbsp;tape. It’s the case of&nbsp;an&nbsp;early 2015 flight whose passengers noticed a&nbsp;curious object just floating over the ocean. The pilots have yet to&nbsp;figure out what they actually saw back there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/de5/837/1ee6ef56fb88b6c797004796a8.png><p>Ok, not all of&nbsp;the possible explanations have been this unusual. Oceanographers, for example, have also tried to&nbsp;explain why ships disappear around here. So, they recently came back to&nbsp;one of&nbsp;their old theories: rogue waves. They are immense walls of&nbsp;water that just pop up&nbsp;suddenly. If&nbsp;multiple such waves rise simultaneously, they overlap, like a&nbsp;wave sandwich. If&nbsp;one single wave can reach over 30&nbsp;feet tall and happen simultaneously, it&nbsp;can create a&nbsp;rogue wave that can surpass 100 feet high. These types of&nbsp;waves can quickly overtake even the biggest of&nbsp;ships. Meteorologists came up&nbsp;with their own explanation, too: hexagonal clouds. These unusual types of&nbsp;clouds can generate winds of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;170mph. And they are pretty significant, too, some reaching 20&nbsp;to&nbsp;55&nbsp;miles across. As&nbsp;such, waves inside these wind giants can go&nbsp;as&nbsp;high as&nbsp;45&nbsp;feet.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/287/b66/f28b8053bf889c5b5725e7ddbc.png><p>The Earth’s own magnetic force might also have something to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it. Within the Bermuda Triangle, compasses point to&nbsp;true north, the geographic North Pole, rather than magnetic north, the shifting magnetic North Pole. Some have even explained that since these two perfectly overlap in&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle, it&nbsp;can cause a&nbsp;magnetic phenomenon that could make navigation devices malfunction. It’s called the agonic line. The problem is&nbsp;that scientists have discovered that this line moves each year. It&nbsp;might have passed through the Bermuda Triangle at&nbsp;one point, but it’s now through the Gulf of&nbsp;Mexico.</p><p>Other strange natural phenomena found along the coast of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Norway data-link=tag>Norway</a> could help explain why the Bermuda Triangle has claimed so&nbsp;many ships. There are some craters there&nbsp;— measuring up&nbsp;to&nbsp;half a&nbsp;mile wide and are 150&nbsp;ft deep. Scientists believe they were created by&nbsp;methane gas bubbles.<br>This gas seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;leaking from deposits hidden deep in&nbsp;the seabed. Once the gas reaches a&nbsp;certain quantity, it&nbsp;bursts to&nbsp;the surface and causes eruptions. So, do&nbsp;pilots and ship captains actually avoid this area today? Could this explain why there are fewer ships that get lost there nowadays?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8a5/bd2/bc65c556b0814931c8bd10bbb4.png><p>But, if&nbsp;you’ve ever flown from Miami to&nbsp;San Juan, Puerto Rico, you probably know that’s not true. As&nbsp;for ships, if&nbsp;people would avoid the Bermuda Triangle, nearly all Caribbean vacations would be&nbsp;spoiled. To&nbsp;this day, there are a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;flights that go&nbsp;over the Bermuda Triangle, so&nbsp;it’s clear nobody is&nbsp;avoiding&nbsp;it.</p><p>This place is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in&nbsp;the world. Nowadays, the Bermuda Triangle has heavy daily traffic, both by&nbsp;sea and air. But the Bermuda Triangle is&nbsp;indeed subject to&nbsp;tropical storms and hurricanes that happen very often. Let’s keep in&nbsp;mind that The Gulf Stream—a strong ocean current that causes sharp changes in&nbsp;local weather—passes through the Bermuda Triangle. Besides, the deepest point in&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean, the Milwaukee Depth, is&nbsp;also located in&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle. The Puerto Rico Trench reaches almost 27,500 feet at&nbsp;the Milwaukee Depth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/653/b76/2066625889bfdb41d822ec6c22.jpg><p>So, if&nbsp;you think about&nbsp;it, the whole mystery is&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect combo of&nbsp;human error, bad weather, and a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;ship traffic. This was confirmed by&nbsp;data provided by&nbsp;the U.S. Coastguard. If&nbsp;you look at&nbsp;percentages, the number of&nbsp;ships or&nbsp;planes that go&nbsp;missing in&nbsp;the Bermuda Triangle isn’t different from anywhere else. Disappearances do&nbsp;not happen more often than in&nbsp;any comparable region of&nbsp;the Atlantic Ocean. Official statistics say that around 50&nbsp;ships and 20&nbsp;airplanes have vanished while traveling through this region. That’s another reason why the total number is&nbsp;so&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;pinpoint. Nobody could describe its rescue in&nbsp;official records if&nbsp;a&nbsp;boat was reported missing. There are also some events that, it&nbsp;turns out, didn’t happen at&nbsp;all, adding up&nbsp;to&nbsp;those false reports. Like that of&nbsp;a&nbsp;plane crash back in&nbsp;1937, off Daytona Beach, Florida, that local papers, surprisingly, revealed nothing about.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYytn55lkpq%2FrsHDmmStqpmWu6i4xGagrGWemsOmvoyopWaZXaKusXmXampqcWFk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
