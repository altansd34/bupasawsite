The singer will show off her acting chops on the hit high school drama as a recurring cast member. The former teen star will make her first appearance on the February 21 episode as the show continues into Season 4.</strong></p><p>The singer will play a world famous recording artist named Sabine. Life will imitate art for JoJo as her character was a young singer since the age of 10. JoJo’s own singing career started when she was 12 years old. JoJo’s character is in search of a new sound and she decides to work with the character Layla on a new album. Sabine is described as a character who knows what she wants and will make her dreams happen.</p><p>JoJo has also adopted a new sound much like her character. In real life JoJo’s battle with her old record label played out in public, leading JoJo to re-record her first two albums.</p><p>If there is any indication from All American‘s first three seasons, fans can expect JoJo’s character to get into some of the drama that plagues the other characters. The show has been a hit for the CW. Since the premiere All American has been the network’s highest performing show. It also spawned the spin-off series All American: Homecoming.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CZvFTfrJN2a/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jojo-s-in-control-of-her-career>JoJo’s in Control of Her Career</h2><p>With news of her new acting role, JoJo’s career seems to be on the right path back on top. The singer made history at 13 years old by being the youngest artist ever to top the billboard chops. Since then, the young singer saw mild success until public disputes put a roadblock in her career.</p><p>Years later JoJo has been releasing new music. Her new sound takes the soulful R&B route instead of the pop music we were used to. She has appeared on Season 5 on <a href=#>The Masked Singer</a> and she is currently on tour.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1353023638-e1644944275712.jpg alt="Gabby Barrett Joins Jason Aldean’s Rock ‘N Roll Cowboy tour" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>JoJo</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaihqGWapLavv4ytn55lk6x6tLHRopysZZGhuW6tzJ6popuRo3qquoyrnJytoqe2r7OMq6alnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
