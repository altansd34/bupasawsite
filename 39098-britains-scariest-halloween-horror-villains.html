We put a list of 18 seasonal movie monsters and madmen to the public and asked them to choose the three that they find most terrifying.</p><p>Topping the list is Antony Hopkin’s iconic performance as the psychiatrist-turned-cannibal Doctor Hannibal Lecter from 1991’s Silence of the Lambs, chosen by 19% of Brits. Tied for the top spot is a much more recent character, Pennywise the Clown, from the 2017 movie adaptation of Stephen King’s It, which sends chills down the spines of another 19% of Brits.</p><p>Classic horror villain Freddy Kruger, first seen in The Nightmare on Elm Street, comes third with 17% listing the dream-invading killer as a top terror.</p><p>Beyond the top three, 12% of Brits listed the reincarnated serial killer doll Chucky from Child’s Play among their scariest characters. Another 11% said the same for Damien, the child antichrist from The Omen.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/hannibal-and-pennywise-scariest-villains.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Another staple horror character, Leatherface from 1971’s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, was picked as among the top three most frightful characters by 10% of Brits. Some 9% picked Jigsaw from the Saw series and Samara from The Ring as being among of the scariest.</p><p>Michael Myers from the Halloween series was only picked as being among the most hair-raising characters by 8% of Brits – despite the Halloween films being widely credited as the inspiration for the wider “slasher” genre.</p><p>There are significant generational differences in which characters give Brits the shivers. For example, Hannibal was listed as among the scariest characters by nearly three in ten (29%) of those aged 65 and over, but only 16% of those aged between 18 and 24.</p><p>Topping the list among these young adults is Pennywise (19%) – however, it is people aged 25-49 who are most likely to have the dancing cosmic clown as one of their sinister villains (26%).</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6aqa2hk6GytHuScmdycF2Xv6rAwKKlrGWjmK6ztcSsq2agkaG5sMPEnqVmoJ%2Bnv7C%2BjK%2BgpaSRnru0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
