They introduced the idea&nbsp;of... some fancy French word&nbsp;— eating small amounts of&nbsp;beautifully served food. Five, ten, fifteen, up&nbsp;to&nbsp;twenty <strong>courses</strong>! In&nbsp;one meal you could try soups, appetizers, pastries, pastas, risottos... all that good stuff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2c7/3f5/e904085e5d9730f3c4414e7b5d.png><p>When you go&nbsp;to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=restaurant data-link=tag>restaurant</a> to&nbsp;try a&nbsp;new dish, it&nbsp;stops tasting life-changing after about the 10th mouthful. When you’re only given a&nbsp;few bites worth, you somehow appreciate the taste more! Luxury restaurants always try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;as&nbsp;different as&nbsp;they can from cheaper places. They’ve got elegant interiors, expensive cutlery, and small portions&nbsp;— the opposite of&nbsp;what you get at&nbsp;your regular diner. It&nbsp;makes the meal more unusual...that’s why it’s more memorable.</p><p>Truffles, caviar...all those fancy-schmancy ingredients cost a&nbsp;lot, and deep down, you know that. So&nbsp;when you see them bring a&nbsp;tiny plate with a&nbsp;tiny serving, your brain’s happy. <strong>It’s logical</strong> somehow. How would you feel if&nbsp;you ordered a&nbsp;cheap plate of&nbsp;something fancy, and it&nbsp;was huge? You’d be&nbsp;weirded out, wondering if&nbsp;the quality was low or&nbsp;something.</p><p>Luxury restaurants get their ingredients from various places, It’s not really a&nbsp;one-stop-shop thing. That adds up&nbsp;fast. A&nbsp;bigger portion would be&nbsp;so&nbsp;expensive, even for the wealthiest customers.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/709/f99/aba8995becab7878bc15afece4.png><p>Most fancy restaurants have at&nbsp;least 3&nbsp;to&nbsp;6<strong>&nbsp;course meals</strong>. At&nbsp;some, you might get up&nbsp;to&nbsp;30! You wouldn’t be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;try them all if&nbsp;they were regular size. And, if&nbsp;they keep the portion <strong>sizes down</strong>, you’ll have room for dessert and a&nbsp;fancy coffee, which means extra money for the restaurant.</p><p>It’s all designed to&nbsp;give you the “<strong>limited edition</strong>” vibe. You’re always more likely to&nbsp;appreciate something that’s rare and exclusive. A&nbsp;mountain of&nbsp;pasta is&nbsp;something you can cook at&nbsp;home any old time. Some strands of&nbsp;multicolored pasta spread across a&nbsp;plate of&nbsp;exotic veggies? That’s got food-selfie written all over&nbsp;it!</p><p>Now, gourmet chefs don’t just cook&nbsp;— they create edible works of&nbsp;art. And it’s a&nbsp;lot easier to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;masterpiece with fewer things on&nbsp;the plate. The more you slap on&nbsp;there, the more it’ll look like that meal you cook when you’re just trying to&nbsp;empty out your fridge. And for the customer, it’s not easy to&nbsp;look elegant when you’re trying to&nbsp;shove a&nbsp;huge burger in&nbsp;your mouth. When you’re eating your tiny portion at&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy table wearing nice clothes, you can’t not look elegant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/399/3dd/1e0f0450c7884f5b1c884b4b34.png><p>Some restaurants are switching it&nbsp;up, offering <strong>regular</strong> and <strong>smaller</strong> size meal options. It’s perfect if&nbsp;you can’t eat that much, are dieting or&nbsp;want to&nbsp;save some money. But it’s not like the smaller portions are going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fancier, they’ll just be&nbsp;smaller. Most restaurants have dim lighting and cozy secluded seating areas to&nbsp;make you feel more comfortable and relaxed... and stay longer... and order more! You’ll feel less guilty about ordering a&nbsp;ton of&nbsp;expensive food when you feel “invisible” in&nbsp;the dark.</p><p>Smells can affect your meal choices. Vanilla and cinnamon make you crave dessert. The smell of&nbsp;bacon might make you order a&nbsp;bigger breakfast. <a href=# title=Lavender data-link=tag>Lavender</a> helps you relax, slow down, and eat and spend more. Fancy restaurants use incense and nice-smelling oils to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;make you order more! At&nbsp;cheaper restaurants it’s all different.</p><p>When you sit by&nbsp;the window and see people and sunlight, you’re more likely to&nbsp;feel conscious of&nbsp;your choices and order something healthy and sensible like vegetables, wraps, you know, that sort of&nbsp;thing, and you’re more likely to&nbsp;order a&nbsp;full meal ’cause you think someone might judge you or&nbsp;something.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/23e/bb2/44d41650b19f7f02571df507fc.png><p>They put up&nbsp;TVs everywhere to&nbsp;distract you. That way you’re more likely to&nbsp;agree to&nbsp;whatever the waiter’s offering you. Sitting at&nbsp;a&nbsp;high-top bar table makes you more alert, since you can’t lean back and relax. You’re more likely to&nbsp;order, eat, and leave. Then they can fill the table with someone else!</p><p>Where can you always find fast food? At&nbsp;the mall and at&nbsp;any rest stop. They’re hoping you just impulse buy something, even when you’re not hungry. Just looking at&nbsp;food or&nbsp;people eating can make you crave that burger!</p><p>And restaurants pay big bucks to&nbsp;get help designing their <strong>menus</strong>. They use something called “<strong>power positioning</strong>”. It&nbsp;helps you pick something, even if&nbsp;you didn’t know you wanted&nbsp;it! Whatever’s on&nbsp;the top right of&nbsp;the front page: that’s what they want you to&nbsp;order. You’ll always see the most expensive ingredients mentioned in&nbsp;the dish description, even if&nbsp;it&nbsp;only has one tiny drop of&nbsp;it. You’ll want to&nbsp;order it&nbsp;for that luxury vibe...</p><p>Some gourmet restaurants really do&nbsp;make their specials out of&nbsp;the freshest ingredients, the ones they just got in&nbsp;that morning. Most specials though?<strong> </strong>They’re made from stuff that’s about to&nbsp;expire, that way they don’t waste as&nbsp;much food. And watch out!</p><p>The specials at&nbsp;fancy restaurants might cost more than your new iPhone! Even the most luxurious places can’t always cook everything from scratch. Frozen veggies zapped in&nbsp;the microwave, vacuum-packed soups they dump in&nbsp;hot water... They might even use leftover shredded veggies from the salad bar to&nbsp;make tomorrow’s soup of&nbsp;the day!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e68/247/cc47b659c595046fa93c4ea2de.png><p>When the greeter at&nbsp;the front door tells you there’s a&nbsp;<strong>20</strong>-<strong>minute wait</strong>, they just made it&nbsp;up. Can they see into the future? How do&nbsp;they know exactly how long it’s going to&nbsp;take for that couple at&nbsp;the corner table to&nbsp;finish their pasta and leave? That specific wait time just makes you feel more relaxed, plus it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;look like the restaurant’s really well managed.</p><p>The restaurant manager knows you’re more likely to&nbsp;order a&nbsp;<strong>$20 pizza</strong> if&nbsp;it’s right below a&nbsp;<strong>$45&nbsp;steak</strong>. You might also fall for the special “<strong>$3&nbsp;off</strong> dessert” even if&nbsp;it’s still <strong>$15</strong>! It’s called <strong>the anchoring effect</strong>. Your brain gets stuck on&nbsp;the “$3&nbsp;off” bit and ignores the actual price!</p><p>When a&nbsp;friendly waiter invites you to&nbsp;take another look at&nbsp;the menu, it’s impossible to&nbsp;say “no”. You naturally want to&nbsp;please others. The waiters know which items to&nbsp;push, and they’ll describe them to&nbsp;you in&nbsp;the most beautiful way or&nbsp;recommend them as&nbsp;their personal favorites. Just try&nbsp;it: Ask them to&nbsp;recommend you a&nbsp;dessert, I&nbsp;bet you anything it’ll be&nbsp;the most expensive one.</p><p>The music you hear at&nbsp;restaurants affects the taste of&nbsp;food. You’re more likely to&nbsp;rate your pasta or&nbsp;pizza as&nbsp;authentic if&nbsp;they’re pumping out some Italian opera jams. Chips taste fresher when they crunch super loud, and oysters feel saltier when there’s some sort of&nbsp;Caribbean music going&nbsp;on. Waiters always want to&nbsp;start you off with a&nbsp;drink before you even open the menu, to&nbsp;catch you off guard. And if&nbsp;one person orders a&nbsp;pricey drink, chances are everyone else will too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c9b/21a/4fdbd35977a23b5009e29c069e.png><p>Menus that don’t use dollar signs make you feel better and more relaxed about spending money. And they don’t use cents either&nbsp;— the fewer numbers you see, the more you’re going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;willing to&nbsp;pay. You’re more likely to&nbsp;order a&nbsp;meal that has a&nbsp;long juicy name like “<strong>seasoned, wood-fired-grilled fish fillet with our head chef’s signature sauce and Uncle John’s secret recipe fried potatoes</strong>”... I’m in, hey, (exhale). Sorry guys.</p><p>That sounds better than “<strong>grilled fish with potatoes</strong>.” The first one sounds expensive, and like it’s a&nbsp;secret family recipe. Restaurants always like to&nbsp;make meals sound more authentic. That’s why they’re always loaded with foreign words, makes it&nbsp;seem extra fancy!</p><p>Restaurants get busy at&nbsp;lunch, at&nbsp;least that’s the plan. To&nbsp;stop you from noticing that your meal’s taking forever, they slow everything else down too. They’ll keep you waiting for a&nbsp;table, then seat you at&nbsp;an&nbsp;empty table, then put out the dishes and cutlery, then bring you the menu, then... you get the picture.</p><p>Sorry to&nbsp;burst your bubble, but you aren’t always the first customer to&nbsp;get that bread basket. What’s left from the previous guest...you might be&nbsp;eating that right now! When waiters bring you free snacks, they’re trying to&nbsp;make you thirsty. All those chips and crackers are packed with sodium. When you eat too much of&nbsp;it, your body sends a&nbsp;signal to&nbsp;your kidneys that it’s time to&nbsp;flush out the system. Before you know&nbsp;it, you’re ordering a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;extra drinks!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGprdOsZLCgqWKzorrCsmSrnaOprra%2BwKerrGWjmr%2B3sYysrJygXam2r8WMqaarrJmku7R5l2prbWtoZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
