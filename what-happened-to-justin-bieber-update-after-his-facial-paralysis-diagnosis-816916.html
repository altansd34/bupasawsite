Concerned fans began questioning the reason behind this development, asking, “What happened to&nbsp;Justin Bieber?” The 29-year-old celebrity addressed the situation in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a> video, explaining that he&nbsp;was experiencing facial paralysis as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;being diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> clearly showed how the singer could not move the right side of&nbsp;his face.</p><p><h2>Health problems</h2></p><p>“As&nbsp;you can see, this eye is&nbsp;not blinking. I&nbsp;can’t smile on&nbsp;this side of&nbsp;my&nbsp;face... So&nbsp;there’s full paralysis on&nbsp;this side of&nbsp;my&nbsp;face,” the singer started his video explanation.</p><p>Medical experts describe Ramsay Hunt syndrome as&nbsp;a&nbsp;condition where a&nbsp;shingles outbreak affects the facial nerve near the ears. In&nbsp;June 2022, three shows of&nbsp;Bieber’s Justice World Tour, which commenced in&nbsp;February, were announced to&nbsp;be&nbsp;postponed.</p><p>“It&nbsp;is&nbsp;from this virus that attacks the nerve in&nbsp;my&nbsp;ear and my&nbsp;facial nerves and has caused my&nbsp;face to&nbsp;have paralysis,” the Canadian-born singer elaborated in&nbsp;the three-minute video, pointing to&nbsp;the right side of&nbsp;his face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/368/e66/73d18e5501a60578dd3e68e8b4.jpg><p>Requesting patience from his fans, he&nbsp;admitted he&nbsp;is&nbsp;“physically, obviously, not capable of&nbsp;doing” the upcoming shows. While smiling and blinking, he&nbsp;demonstrated to&nbsp;his 290 million followers that the right side of&nbsp;his face remained immobile.</p><p>“This is&nbsp;pretty serious, as&nbsp;you can see. I&nbsp;wish this wasn’t the case, but, obviously, my&nbsp;body’s telling me&nbsp;I’ve got to&nbsp;slow down,” he&nbsp;stated. “I&nbsp;hope you guys understand. I’ll be&nbsp;using this time to&nbsp;just rest and relax and get back to&nbsp;a&nbsp;hundred percent so&nbsp;that&nbsp;I can do&nbsp;what&nbsp;I was born to&nbsp;do.” Bieber mentioned engaging in&nbsp;facial exercises to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;normal but expressed uncertainty about the duration of&nbsp;his recovery.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>the Mayo Clinic</a> in&nbsp;the US, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, aside from the painful shingles rash, can lead to&nbsp;facial paralysis and hearing loss in&nbsp;the affected ear. While symptoms are typically temporary, they can become permanent for some individuals. The clinic notes that the inability to&nbsp;close one eyelid may cause eye pain and blurred vision, with the condition being more common in&nbsp;individuals over 60&nbsp;years old.</p><p><h2>An&nbsp;upbeat update on&nbsp;his recovery from facial paralysis</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12a/e4d/071a41580b8494cc0d30a06ce0.jpg><p>Nine months after revealing his Ramsay Hunt syndrome diagnosis, Justin Bieber shared a&nbsp;joyful update on&nbsp;his recovery.

One fan enthusiastically <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exclaimed</a>, “His smile,” while another fondly remarked, “his smile was always perfect.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/031/1b5/38665d55abaa08e3e67f52e6fc.jpg><p>LISA O'CONNOR/AFP/East News</p><p>Reflecting on&nbsp;the timeline of&nbsp;events, the postponement of&nbsp;Justin’s Justice World Tour in&nbsp;September 2022, prompted by&nbsp;health concerns, led to&nbsp;the subsequent cancellation of&nbsp;the remaining tour dates in&nbsp;February 2023. Fans were formally <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>notified</a> via email that the remaining 70&nbsp;shows would be&nbsp;canceled to&nbsp;give Justin the necessary time and space to&nbsp;prioritize his health and well-being.</p><p>“Earlier this year, I&nbsp;went public about my&nbsp;battle with Ramsay-Hunt Syndrome, where my&nbsp;face was partially paralyzed. As&nbsp;the result of&nbsp;this illness, I&nbsp;was not able to&nbsp;complete the North American leg of&nbsp;the Justice tour,” Justin <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a> on&nbsp;Instagram in&nbsp;September 2022.</p><p><h2>In&nbsp;2020 singer revealed that he&nbsp;has Lyme disease</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8e/f1b/a44ed95663a4516c7081c3e377.jpg><p>Unfortunately, this wasn’t the first time that the artist has faced a&nbsp;serious health problem and fans asked a&nbsp;disturbing question, “What Happened to&nbsp;Justin Bieber?”</p><p>In&nbsp;January 2020, Justin Bieber took to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Instagram</a> to&nbsp;<strong>reveal his battle with both </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>Lyme Disease</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>chronic mononucleosis</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Despite facing criticism about his appearance, he&nbsp;explained the underlying health issues he&nbsp;had been dealing with, affecting his <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a>, brain function, <a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a>, and overall well-being. Bieber announced his intention to&nbsp;share more about his journey through <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>a&nbsp;documentary series on&nbsp;YouTube</a>. In&nbsp;his statement, he&nbsp;acknowledged the challenging past couple of&nbsp;years but expressed optimism about receiving the right treatment for these serious illnesses, emphasizing his determination to&nbsp;come back stronger than ever.</p><p>The use of&nbsp;a&nbsp;euphemism for a&nbsp;negative comment in&nbsp;his Instagram post is&nbsp;noteworthy. Suffering from Lyme Disease can indeed have visible effects on&nbsp;a&nbsp;person’s appearance, and the disease itself is&nbsp;challenging. It&nbsp;originates from the bite of&nbsp;a&nbsp;blacklegged tick, also known as&nbsp;the deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), which can quietly latch onto the skin during outdoor activities. His post shed light on&nbsp;the physical and emotional toll of&nbsp;these health struggles, while Bieber remains hopeful about overcoming the hurdles posed by&nbsp;these illnesses.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3dc/650/6f0a435196b8f6dab7446dab76.jpg><p>A&nbsp;year later, Hailey Bieber, Justin Bieber’s wife, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discussed</a> the insights she gained from his experience with Lyme disease.</p><p>The 27-year-old model appeared as&nbsp;a&nbsp;guest on&nbsp;the Women’s Health UK&nbsp;podcast, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Going for Goal</i></a>, where she shared that her husband’s health challenges have heightened her awareness of&nbsp;any potential issues she might be&nbsp;facing. “I&nbsp;think with the Lyme disease and that situation, it&nbsp;definitely makes you more aware of&nbsp;your health, and&nbsp;I think it&nbsp;makes you pay more attention to&nbsp;how you feel and different symptoms,” Hailey <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>expressed</a>.</p><p>She went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;discuss the complexities of&nbsp;Lyme disease, noting that some people doubt its existence.
