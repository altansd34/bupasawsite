That’s why he struck the deal,” Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) told reporters Thursday at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg. “If there’s a bit of good news for conservatives, it’s all about that we’re going to move that agenda forward.”</p><p>If Meadows is right — he said he spoke to Trump on Wednesday after the deal was announced between Trump, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) — Trump’s focus on tax reform this fall would put him in line with a plurality of voters and more than half of Republican voters.</p><p>According to an Aug. 31-Sept. 3&nbsp;<a href=#>Morning Consult/POLITICO poll</a>, 38 percent of registered voters said tax reform should be a top priority for Congress upon its return from August recess. Another 31 percent said it was an important but lower priority. Among Republican voters, 53 percent described it as a top priority, compared with 27 percent of Democratic voters who said the same.</p><p>Speaking with reporters on Capitol Hill Thursday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) described tax reform as “our No. 1 priority this fall.”</p><p>“I hope the Democrats join us,” he said when asked about possible bipartisan action on the issue. But Ryan said he would stick with the GOP plan to use a procedural measure to advance a tax overhaul that would not require any Democratic votes in the Senate if Republicans stick together.</p><p>Pelosi, also speaking with reporters on Thursday, was dismissive about&nbsp;the tax reform proposals being pitched by Republicans, describing them as “detrimental to everything we would care about.”</p><p>On the debt limit issue, she&nbsp;said Democrats ended up with the upper hand because Republicans did not have enough support for a proposed 18-month extension when a bipartisan group of congressional leaders met in the Oval Office with Trump on Wednesday.</p><p>“If you have the votes, no discussion,” she said. “If you don’t have the votes, three months.”</p><p>Twenty-eight percent of voters said Congress should make raising the debt ceiling a top priority upon its return, including 27 percent of Republican voters. On the issue of hurricane relief funding, <a href=#>67 percent of voters</a>&nbsp;said recovery from the storms in Texas and Louisiana should be a top priority.</p><p>Nineteen percent of voters said Congress should make it a top priority to fund Trump’s wall along the border with Mexico.</p><p>The total percentage of voters who prioritize border wall spending includes 32 percent of Republican voters — 5 percent more than the percentage of Republican voters who favor Congress prioritizing a debt limit hike.</p><p>Ryan, who prior to meeting with Trump described a short-term debt limit hike as “ridiculous and disgraceful,” said Trump made a “game call” in agreeing to tie hurricane funding to the debt ceiling.</p><p>“What he was aiming for in that meeting yesterday was a bipartisan moment while the country is facing two horrible hurricanes,” he said, adding later:&nbsp;“We all thought we had more time to deal with the debt limit issue — that’s before the hurricanes hit.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiln6e7qrrGnKanq6WhwW%2BvzqZma2hhbHxxhY5pbmillZaxsMPSZqqasaNiwbPBzKlkprGfpbakrculsGaen5jCtLHDZquasF2nsqe70aZm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
