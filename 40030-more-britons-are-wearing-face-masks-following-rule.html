This was soon followed by <a href=#>additional rules on wearing masks</a> in other venues such as theatres and cinemas last Friday.</p><p>With these restrictions now in place, new YouGov data shows mask-wearing has increased significantly compared to when it was not mandatory. When asked how often they had worn a mask in shops during the previous 7 days, almost eight in ten who had been shopping that week (78%) now say they wore a mask every time. This is up from just half (49%) in <a href=#>October this year</a>.</p><p>The proportion of people who wore a mask occasionally or most of the time has fallen from 31% in <a href=#>October</a> to 16% now, while just 5% now say they didn’t wear a mask on any of their shop visits in the previous seven days (down from <a href=#>20%</a>). This translates to just 22% not wearing a mask on at least one shop visit, down from 51% a couple of months ago.</p><p>People aged 18-24 are less likely to say they have worn a mask every time they’ve visited a shop (60%) than older age groups, though only 8% of this group are never wearing masks. The main difference is that far more younger adults are wearing a mask most or some of the time (32%).</p><p>Support for masks being compulsory in shops has remained largely unchanged since coming into place. In <a href=#>October</a>, three-quarters of the English public (76%) supported the re-introduction compared to 18% who opposed it. Now the policy has been brough back, some 80% support the decision, versus 17% who are opposed to it.</p><p>As is to be expected, mask compliance varies when comparing these two groups. However, even those who oppose the policy are somewhat compliant with just a third (33%) not wearing one at all. Just over a quarter (28%) of these people say they wore a mask on every shop visit, but around four in ten (39%) say they wore a mask some or most of the time they went to a shop.</p><p>The much larger group of supporters of mandatory mask-wearing, self-report high compliance. Approaching nine in ten (88%) say they used a mask on every shop visit during the previous seven days, 12% on most or some of the visits, and less than 1% didn’t wear one at all.</p><p><strong>See full results <a href=#>here</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGV9dHyMpqarnV2Xv6rAzqeqZpmimnq4scCroKefXZuupLGMppiso6Nis7C4y6iuoqaXYr%2B2uMQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
