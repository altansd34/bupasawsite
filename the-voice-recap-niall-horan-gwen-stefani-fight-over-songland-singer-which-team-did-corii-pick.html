Week 2 is already off to a great start, with various impressive performances, multiple four-chair turns and even a steal. Here’s everything you missed in the episode.</strong></p><p>The first battle of the episode was between Team Gwen members BIAS and Jacquie Roar. Superfans of the series were able to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">see this battle early</a>, on The Voice‘s YouTube channel. In the end, Stefani decided to keep BIAS on her team. Luckily, Jacquie’s time on the series isn’t over, Reba McEntire hit her steal for the singer.</p><p>For Team Gwen’s second battle of the night, the pop star paired Latin singer Juliette Ojeda and country singer Kristen Brown. For this battle, the two performed “That’s the Way It Is” by Celine Dion. Although both artists sang their hearts out on stage, Stefani had to pick a winner. The coach decided that Kristen won the battle.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Our hearts will always go on for <a href=#>@kristenb_music</a> and Juliette Ojeda. 💖 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/SjtYcGtdwF</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 24, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-beautiful-vocalists-impress-with-you-say-by-lauren-daigle-cover>Beautiful Vocalists Impress With “You Say” by Lauren Daigle Cover</h2><p>Up next was McEntire’s team. McEntire paired Angelina Nazarian and Alison Albrecht. For those who may not remember, Angelina turned two chairs with her rendition of Kelly Clarkson’s “The Trouble With Love Is,” and Alison turned one chair with her rendition of Alanis Morissette’s “Ironic.”</p><p>In their battle, the singers performed “You Say” by Lauren Daigle. I truly thought that Alison stood out the most in this performance. I thought her voice was so unique, and she emotionally invested a lot, more than her 17 year old duet partner. Other coaches said that Alison should be the winner of the battle, and McEntre agreed. She picked Alison as the winner.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>We’re staying SEATED for Alison Albrecht and Angelina Nazarian’s cover of “You Stay” by Lauren Daigle. 🌟 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/popxL9wwC3</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 24, 2023</a><p>The final performance of the episode featured another Team Reba pair, Corii and Ms Monét. The pair sang an upbeat rendition of “New Attitude” by Patti LaBelle. Coaches absolutely loved this performance, but none were impressed more than McEntire herself. After listening to the other coaches, McEntire picked Ms. Monét as the winner.</p><p>After the show that Corii put on, coaches couldn’t let her leave the competition. Both Horan and Stefani hit their steal buttons for the singer. In the end, Corii chose to join Team Gwen for the Knockout Rounds.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-niall-horan-pairs-13-15-year-old-singers-together>Niall Horan Pairs 13, 15 Year Old Singers Together</h2><p>For the first Team Niall performance of the episode, the coach paired 13 year old Julia Roome and 15 year old Olivia Eden. In the Blind Auditions, Julia sang “Dream a Little Dream of Me” by Doris Day, while Olivia sang Horan’s song “This Town.”</p><p>In their battle, Julia and Olivia sang “Kiss Me” by Sixpence None The Richer. Even though these two are the youngest competitors this season, they put on quite the battle. Aside from some obvious nerves, they both shined in their own ways. Other coaches commented on how both singers are extremely unique performers, so it’s hard to pick. In the end, Horan picked Julia as the winner.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Feeling beneath the milky twilight 🌙 thanks to <a href=#>@oliviaedenmusic</a> and Julia Roome. <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cCLsavNw3F</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 24, 2023</a><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-two-four-chair-turns-battle-it-out>Two Four-Chair Turns Battle it Out</h2><p>As for the first Team Legend battle of this episode, Legend paired Stee and Willie Gomez. The two incredibly talented artists battled it out to Legend’s song, “Tacones rojos” by Legend and Sebastián Yatra.</p><p>These singers practically created the definition of the best The Voice battle ever. When putting together two four-chair turns, this type of excellence is desired. It was clear even Legend was unsure who the winner of this battle really was. In the end, Legend picked Stee as the winner.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Leave it to <a href=#>@williegomez</a> and Stee to get us UP on our feet dancing. 🕺💃 <a href=#>#TheVoice</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/uLpa4zHias</a></p>— The Voice (@NBCTheVoice) <a href=#>October 24, 2023</a><p>The Voice premieres the next set of Battles on Tuesday, October 24 at 9 p.m. ET.
