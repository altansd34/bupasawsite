He was the co-founder and C.E.O. of the now-defunct Death Row Records and one of the forces behind the global success of the gangsta-rap music genre.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/13c2a8e5448af9e0.jpg><h3>Where is Suge Knight from?</h3><p class=align-left>He was born in Compton, California, U.S.A., to Maxine Chatman (mum) and Marion Knight Sr (dad). Suge Knight's parents had two more children named Karen Anderson and Charlinda Tubbs.</p><h3>How old is Suge Knight?</h3><p class=align-left>Suge Knight's age is 56 years as of 2021 because <a href=#>his birthday </a>was 19th April 1965. His childhood nickname, Sugar Bear, gave rise to the Suge stage name when he became a star.</p><h3>Suge Knight's height and body measurements</h3><p class=align-left>The former record label owner has a large body frame. So, how tall is Suge Knight? He is 6 feet 2 inches tall and weighs about 120 kilograms. Additionally, the man has dark brown eyes and black hair. His imposing body is one of his distinctive features.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/33d1dac82b79adb4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kelley Cahill’s biography: what is known about Jon Rahm’s wife?</span></p></a><h3>Educational background</h3><p class=align-left>Hugh graduated from Lynwood High School in 1983. Since he was among its best track athletes and football players, Marion played for El Camino College's football team for two years before transferring to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, in 1985.</p><h3>Who was Suge Knight's wife?</h3><p class=align-left>He proposed to his high school sweetheart, Sharitha Lee, in 1989. They <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">both attended the</a> University of Nevada but ended the marriage due to Sage's infidelity.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/8a476728986b6b23.jpg><p class=align-left>He married Michel'le Denise Toussant (American R&B singer) in 1999 while in prison and sent her to rehab. They also had a daughter named Bailei in 2002.</p><p class=align-left>She discovered that their marriage was invalid while seeking a divorce from her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">abusive husband </a>six years later. At that time, Hugh was still married to another woman.</p><p class=align-left>In 2018, Toi Lin Kelly (his fiancé) received a 3-year-sentence for helping him communicate with Death Row's producers in 2015. Before this, the judge had ordered Marion to contact no one else but his lawyer ahead of his murder trial.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e3a45eb7da5b0080.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bill Klein’s biography: where is the member of The Little Couple now?</span></p></a><h3>Suge Knight's children</h3><p class=align-left>Suge and Sharitha Lee have a child named Arion. Snoop Dogg is Arion's godfather. The star then had son Taj with Davina Barnes in 1991. Before getting married to Hugh, Michel'le <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had a daughter</a> named Posh with Dr Dre, which shattered the men's friendship.</p><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, Suge Knight's son, Suge Jacob, is not adopted as some people claim. Instead, the famous music producer, content creator, and realtor<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> is the son of </a>Stormey Ramdhan (Marion's ex-fiancée). She raised him and his younger brother, Sosa, as a single parent.</p><p class=align-left>The youngest one, Legend, was only eight years old when Hugh was imprisoned. Meanwhile, people doubt if Andrew Knight is the artist's son. His mum, Tia Rowe, claims he is Suge's son, yet his real name is Andrew Payan. She <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dated Suge years</a> ago then got married to Ed Payan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/33d1dac82b79adb4.jpg><h3>Career history</h3><p class=align-left>He played for his university's Nevada Wolf Pack team for two years, then moved to the Los Angeles Rams during the 1987 N.F.L. Players Strike. Hugh played two games with the club while working part-time as a concert promoter and escort for celebrity Bobby Brown.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/32f80119171f3a13.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rhonda MCcullough’s biography: what happened to Bernie Mac's wife?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Marion established a music company in 1989 and gained a breakthrough when Vanilla Ice transferred the royalties of his hit single, <i>Ice Ice Baby</i>, to him. It was, however, reported that Hugh's bodyguards harassed the artist severally, thus forcing him to make the big decision.</p><p class=align-left>They even entered Vanilla Ice's hotel room and loosely swung him off the balcony by his ankles. Marion later signed up several rappers to his artists' management company, including The D.O.C, N.W.A., and DJ Quik.</p><h3>The rise and fall of Death Row Records</h3><p class=align-left>He then partnered with Dr Dre, Harry-O (Michael Harris), and The D.O.C in establishing the Death Row recording label. The company was instrumental in the 1990s success of gangster-rap music.</p><p class=align-left>Harris contributed $1.5 million towards the label. Later, he was jailed for partnering with Cali Cartel in a large-scale drug trafficking <a href=#>business</a>. Afterwards, Hugh promised to make Harry's wife Lydia a music star while Harris' attorney (David Kenner) worked as the label's lawyer and managed his investments.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a666526f4ab15aca.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>OhGeesy’s bio: age, height, real name, ethnicity, net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Death Row's early signees were Tupac Shakur, Dr Dre, MC Hammer, and Snoop Dogg, but MC Hammer left shortly after signing up. Snoop Dogg's 1993 debut album <i>D*ggystyle</i> received Quadruple Platinum status, while Dr Dre's 1992 album, <i>The Chronic</i>, earned America's Triple Platinum recognition in the same year.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/294a1ea4d0d47950.jpg><p class=align-left>At that time, Marion's feuds with Sean Combs (Puff Daddy) and the 2 Live Crew were intense.

The label earned a $750 million revenue from the 150 million albums it sold globally before Hugh's imprisonment for parole violations resulting from an assault case dimmed its glory in 1997.</p><p class=align-left>Dr Dre and other prominent artists soon left the label.
