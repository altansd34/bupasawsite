Make sure you save them!</p><p><h2>1. Make them like you from the very beginning.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/36b/98e/c3d2e051fdaece8e85df54f53b.jpg><p>Just don't go overboard!üåä‚úàÔ∏è</p><p>Put effort into establishing a&nbsp;warm and positive connection to&nbsp;let people form a&nbsp;special impression of&nbsp;you. The win-win option here is&nbsp;always going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;sincere <a href=#>smile</a>. However, just one emotion is&nbsp;not enough. A&nbsp;personalized <a href=#>touch</a> like a&nbsp;handshake, a&nbsp;quick tap on&nbsp;the shoulder, or&nbsp;even a&nbsp;short hug, plays a&nbsp;significant role.</p><p>The most important thing here is&nbsp;to&nbsp;try to&nbsp;feel the energy of&nbsp;the other person and follow their <a href=# title="body language" data-link=tag>body language</a> with your own gestures.</p><p><h2>2. Engage them in&nbsp;talking about themselves.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bcc/7dc/5242e35ec5abda954703c503c8.jpg><p>No easy task at the best of times guaranteed!‚úàÔ∏è</p><p>Most people love talking about <a href=#>themselves</a>, so&nbsp;you can make use of&nbsp;this. Ask them about their hobbies, the places they‚Äôve been or&nbsp;might want to&nbsp;visit, plans for the weekend, and much more. Don‚Äôt get too private, as&nbsp;this can make a&nbsp;person feel uncomfortable and they might even try to&nbsp;push you away.</p><p>Also, it‚Äôs good to&nbsp;avoid closed questions where the answer is&nbsp;just a&nbsp;simple ‚Äúyes‚Äù or&nbsp;‚Äúno.‚Äù Instead, make use of&nbsp;the <a href=#>question</a>, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù or&nbsp;‚ÄúHow?‚Äù&nbsp;‚Äî it&nbsp;gives the other person an&nbsp;awesome <a href=#>opportunity</a> to&nbsp;talk more about a&nbsp;chosen topic.</p><p><h2>3. Put an&nbsp;emphasis on&nbsp;the similar traits you both share.</h2></p><p>We&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;be&nbsp;attracted to&nbsp;people who are somewhat similar to&nbsp;us, and this has a&nbsp;name: the ‚Äúsimilarity-attraction <a href=#>effect</a>.‚Äù Try to&nbsp;find something that might be&nbsp;similar in&nbsp;you and the person you‚Äôre talking&nbsp;to. It&nbsp;can be&nbsp;your taste in&nbsp;music, a&nbsp;certain food you both like to&nbsp;eat, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;sport you both enjoy watching. After you‚Äôve found it&nbsp;out, you need to&nbsp;make use of&nbsp;it&nbsp;by&nbsp;discussing it&nbsp;with this person or&nbsp;inviting them to&nbsp;visit the place where you can both enjoy this activity. These simple things might not seem like they are very important, but they do&nbsp;a&nbsp;great job of&nbsp;making people feel personally connected to&nbsp;you, and help them enjoy being around you.</p><p><h2>4. Compliment the things that people struggle with the most.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7ef/fad/bf741d5f61a2ffc566bd73a1f1.jpg><p>Some compliments can awaken a&nbsp;completely different range of&nbsp;feelings in&nbsp;us. Just <a href=#>complimenting</a> someone‚Äôs smile or&nbsp;eye color is&nbsp;not going to&nbsp;make much difference for a&nbsp;person, they will probably see it&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very neutral thing. Naturally, they didn‚Äôt earn these things, they are just a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;who they are. The key here is&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=#>notice</a> the thing that a&nbsp;person struggled with the most and praise them for&nbsp;it.</p><p>For example, let‚Äôs say that you know that this person worked day and night on&nbsp;a&nbsp;project, and it&nbsp;turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;huge success. Admiring their hard work and effort will awaken a&nbsp;deep feeling of&nbsp;satisfaction, making them genuinely happy and even proud of&nbsp;themselves.</p><p><h2>5. Don‚Äôt forget to&nbsp;always be&nbsp;mindful of&nbsp;your body language.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6db/8b2/e674095f7c83445baf9e516383.jpg><p>Even if&nbsp;we&nbsp;don‚Äôt notice&nbsp;it, crossed arms and legs tell others that we&nbsp;can‚Äôt be&nbsp;<a href=#>trusted</a> and that we‚Äôre hiding something. But no&nbsp;matter how hard it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;for you, try to&nbsp;open your stance. The best thing you can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep your spine and legs straight and your hands open with your palms turned toward other people. Putting a&nbsp;relaxed and inviting look on&nbsp;your face will make other people feel more <a href=#>comfortable</a> being around you, and naturally, like you more.</p><p><h2>6. Share the truth about your flaws.</h2></p><p>Some people can get extremely irritated when others try to&nbsp;act like they are perfect. Sharing your weaknesses and failures can make you appear genuine and allow the people around you to&nbsp;feel closer and more <a href=#>engaged</a> with you. Though, make sure you don‚Äôt overdo it&nbsp;and talk about all your failures and bad moments, otherwise the effect will be&nbsp;just the opposite.</p><p><h2>7. Know how to&nbsp;ask for help.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4be/5e5/edb2315ceba013c17fd552da66.jpg><p>Making people think that you need them is&nbsp;always better than asking them to&nbsp;simply do&nbsp;something for you. It&nbsp;makes people feel good about themselves and like you on&nbsp;a&nbsp;deeper level.&nbsp;<a href=#>¬©&nbsp;Doctor_Philly/Reddit</a></p><p><h2>8. Be&nbsp;the first one to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;joke.</h2></p><p>Instead of&nbsp;waiting for someone to&nbsp;loosen up&nbsp;the <a href=#>tension</a> in&nbsp;the room, be&nbsp;the one who takes action&nbsp;‚Äî make a&nbsp;funny yet harmless comment about the situation you are&nbsp;in, the things you‚Äôre working&nbsp;on, etc. If&nbsp;you‚Äôve known the person long enough, you can sometimes tease them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendly way, but remember that you should never attack their identity or&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;something that they can‚Äôt change about themselves. Whoever you are teasing needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;laughing along with you. And don‚Äôt forget to&nbsp;laugh at&nbsp;yourself from time to&nbsp;time as&nbsp;well.</p><p><h2>9. Laugh at&nbsp;someone else‚Äôs jokes too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2cd/e6b/5668db5ebba33663f926f3a642.jpg><p>Support others‚Äô attempts at&nbsp;making the atmosphere more friendly. By&nbsp;laughing along, you will support the other person and help them see that you are listening to&nbsp;them.</p><p>Even if&nbsp;someone makes a&nbsp;bad joke, you can turn it&nbsp;into a&nbsp;funny one by&nbsp;having a&nbsp;good laugh. This way, you will make other people go&nbsp;along with it&nbsp;and make everyone feel <a href=#>good</a>. Always remember: laugh with them, not at&nbsp;them!</p><p><h2>10. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;interesting, act interested.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/164/d75/c648e25973be0dee29f5559ae1.jpg><p>Most of&nbsp;the time, people like to&nbsp;talk rather than listen, and they only appreciate those who pay attention to&nbsp;them. One of&nbsp;the ways to&nbsp;appear as&nbsp;a&nbsp;careful and attentive listener is&nbsp;by&nbsp;repeating the phrases that the person you‚Äôre talking to&nbsp;just said.</p><p>For example, use question tags like, ‚ÄúI&nbsp;know, right?!‚Äù. In&nbsp;addition, don‚Äôt forget to&nbsp;play with <a href=#>encouraging</a> words like, ‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù or&nbsp;‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right!‚Äù and so&nbsp;on. This technique is&nbsp;also called an&nbsp;‚Äúemotionally reflective response.‚Äù</p><p><h2>11. Be&nbsp;a&nbsp;magnet for people around you and engage them.</h2></p><p>Don‚Äôt blend in&nbsp;with the atmosphere and the people that are present in&nbsp;the room. Instead, try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;enthusiastic person. Attract others into having short, but meaningful chats or&nbsp;even longer conversations.</p><p>Try to&nbsp;be&nbsp;one level higher and don‚Äôt be&nbsp;scared of&nbsp;appearing silly. Your positive <a href=#>energy</a> won‚Äôt go&nbsp;unnoticed&nbsp;‚Äî people will eagerly join in&nbsp;and tag along.</p><p><h2>12. Surprise people when they don‚Äôt expect&nbsp;it.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/01d/ecd/0f1f105b4d98b80f79418b1a2b.jpg><p>When people receive something pleasant from others that they didn‚Äôt ask for, it&nbsp;gives them an&nbsp;extraordinarily good feeling. Don‚Äôt be&nbsp;afraid of&nbsp;surprising others with something they might like, without asking their permission to&nbsp;do&nbsp;so. For example, if&nbsp;you are at&nbsp;work and want to&nbsp;go&nbsp;grab yourself a&nbsp;sandwich, you could also grab one more for your colleague. This <a href=#>surprising action</a> will stick in&nbsp;their mind for a&nbsp;long time, and you will be&nbsp;seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;friendly and nice person.</p><p><h2>13. Make friends with other people‚Äôs friends.</h2></p><p>Having people in&nbsp;common, like mutual friends who have ‚Äúsimilarities,‚Äù really matters for&nbsp;us. Establishing a&nbsp;<a href=#>friendship</a> with the acquaintances of&nbsp;others can play a&nbsp;big role in&nbsp;building trust with all of&nbsp;them. Also, it&nbsp;makes people feel closer to&nbsp;each other when they have a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;similar friends. And it‚Äôs a&nbsp;good way to&nbsp;expand the group of&nbsp;people you are in&nbsp;right now.</p><p><h2>14. Proper eye contact can help you.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/be0/9ab/edc82d5f4a918152fde48d91a2.jpg><p>Notice the other person‚Äôs eye color. It‚Äôs needed for establishing <a href=#>good eye contact</a>. The time it&nbsp;takes to&nbsp;notice other people‚Äôs eye color is&nbsp;the most comfortable length of&nbsp;eye-to-eye contact: not too long and uncomfortable for your interlocutor, yet just long enough for them to&nbsp;feel at&nbsp;ease with you.</p><p>Which tactics do&nbsp;you use to&nbsp;make people like you?
