Her heart was filled with <a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> at&nbsp;the thought of&nbsp;finally holding her little bundle of&nbsp;joy in&nbsp;her arms and taking her home to&nbsp;join her husband and son. Unfortunately, life had other plans for her.</p><p>Despite a&nbsp;seemingly uneventful C-section delivery, she would soon face a&nbsp;life-threatening ordeal that would test her strength and courage. Pacheco’s harrowing experience after giving birth is&nbsp;a&nbsp;stark case of&nbsp;how quickly things can take a&nbsp;turn for the worse.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/227/434/74ea095ad1bcb96c26591f4e61.jpg><p>Just 2&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>days</a> after being discharged from the hospital, Krystina Pacheco continued to&nbsp;feel unwell even after taking her medication. She was experiencing fever, vomiting, and shortness of&nbsp;breath during her recovery from delivery. The new mom felt frustrated and worried but ultimately decided to&nbsp;seek medical attention.</p><p>Upon visiting the doctor, she was swiftly rushed to&nbsp;the emergency room and later airlifted to&nbsp;another hospital because of&nbsp;her deteriorating condition. It&nbsp;was determined that she was suffering from septic shock, a&nbsp;life-threatening condition where the body responds aggressively to&nbsp;an&nbsp;infection. The medical team sprang into action, knowing that time was of&nbsp;the essence to&nbsp;save her life.</p><p><h2>The overwhelming fear of&nbsp;not being able to&nbsp;see her babies anymore</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c35/27f/7005cd514cb5ddfb6b19353d6b.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the septic shock took hold, Krystina’s health continued to&nbsp;deteriorate, and the condition began to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;severe impact on&nbsp;her heart, lungs, and kidneys. Her <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>, especially her loving husband Jacob, was understandably distraught and deeply <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>concerned</a>. “They didn’t want to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us how close she was to&nbsp;death, but you could see it&nbsp;in&nbsp;their faces every time I&nbsp;asked.”</p><p>He&nbsp;further added that the doctors had given her a&nbsp;mere&nbsp;20% chance of&nbsp;survival, which was a&nbsp;daunting realization for him. “It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;scary experience for our family,” he&nbsp;said, remembering the anxiety and uncertainty they faced during those trying times. “It&nbsp;was scary.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Krystina Pacheco’s last memory before slipping into unconsciousness was her husband’s urgent plea <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>whispered</a> into her ear. “My&nbsp;husband, I&nbsp;could just hear him saying, ’Please come back to&nbsp;us, please, your babies need you. I&nbsp;need you. I&nbsp;need you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;here and help me&nbsp;with our babies,’ and that’s the last thing I&nbsp;remember.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/314/f05/31e48d5e08b6e3bf82172536b9.jpg><p>During her hospitalization, Jacob had the added responsibility of&nbsp;caring for their newborn daughter and young son. He&nbsp;relied on&nbsp;the support of&nbsp;his family and friends to&nbsp;navigate this trying time, and their constant presence gave him the hope he&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;persevere through the uncertainty of&nbsp;Krystina’s condition. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “It&nbsp;was, living just day by&nbsp;day, just trying to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;Krystina.”</p><p>However, Krystina Pacheco spent the first 2&nbsp;weeks in&nbsp;the intensive care unit receiving the right treatment. In&nbsp;mid-November, her condition improved, and doctors removed her breathing tube, allowing her to&nbsp;speak again. This was a&nbsp;significant turning point for Krystina and her family, giving them a&nbsp;glimmer of&nbsp;hope that she would eventually recover from her illness.</p><p>“The first thing she said to&nbsp;me&nbsp;was, ’What happened to&nbsp;me? Did I&nbsp;almost die?’” Jacob <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recalls</a>. “And we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;tears&nbsp;— tears of&nbsp;sadness, tears of&nbsp;joy, just a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;emotions coming over&nbsp;us.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/38a/1a8/f801a15f8d8a9b7820ac102625.jpg><p>Krystina Pacheco woke up&nbsp;from the medically induced coma only to&nbsp;receive the devastating news that her hands and feet would have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;amputated due to&nbsp;the harm caused by&nbsp;her treatment in&nbsp;the intensive care unit. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;challenging obstacle she considers to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the toughest in&nbsp;her life.</p><p>She recalled, “My&nbsp;hands and feet were black,” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>describing</a> the severity of&nbsp;her situation. She acknowledged that her medical team had done everything they could to&nbsp;prevent the need for amputation, but the damage was irreversible. Pacheco emotionally shared how she “was just breaking down and feeling absolutely crushed.”</p><p>Her journey has been very long, as&nbsp;she endured a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;surgeries after her amputations. “Every day&nbsp;I woke up&nbsp;and thought about my&nbsp;babies, and every time&nbsp;I went into surgery, my&nbsp;thought was, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;get home to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with my&nbsp;babies, so&nbsp;if&nbsp;that means going through one more surgery, then ultimately&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through another surgery,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “They were my&nbsp;number one motivation.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0fb/dc8/c9b4c35d5197f9f573709b8899.jpg><p>Despite the challenges, Pacheco persevered with unwavering strength. Currently, she is&nbsp;working out at&nbsp;home to&nbsp;rebuild her physical strength, and will soon begin outpatient rehabilitation to&nbsp;increase her independence in&nbsp;daily tasks. “It’s a&nbsp;roller coaster. I’m not going to&nbsp;say&nbsp;I don’t have my&nbsp;bad days, because I&nbsp;do,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p>Although settling back into home life has brought new challenges for Pacheco, she remains grateful for the ability to&nbsp;care for not only her children but also herself. These small achievements are significant to&nbsp;her and keep her motivated as&nbsp;she takes life one day at&nbsp;a&nbsp;time. “It’s not easy, and it’s not going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;easy, [...] but if&nbsp;we’re <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sticking</a> together, it&nbsp;makes it&nbsp;that much better.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uuc6tn56qXaG8tLHSZp%2Beql2htq6u0maYn6yVp3qotdWipaBlkp6%2FtbSMm6ytZZaeu6W%2FjKympZmTmnqquoyhnKtlkpavur%2BMpaavnV1tfnODk2xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
