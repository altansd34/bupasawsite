At the time, he and his family were still unsure if his audition will be airing.</p><p>“We are very pleased to announce that Alfie Andrew has auditioned for this year’s AMERICA’S GOT TALENT! Alfie had an amazing time in Los Angeles doing what he loves…sing and entertain!” The caption reads. “Please be rest assured, if and when we are aware that Alfie’s audition will be aired, we will of course share the link to watch his audition as soon as we know.”</p><p>Now, it’s revealed that he’ll appear on June 13’s episode of America’s Got Talent. Soon after this confirmation, his mom uploaded a compilation video of his trip to Los Angeles for his AGT audition. The young singer can be seen taking a picture with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Simon Cowell</a>‘s photo outside of the Pasadena Civic Auditorium, as well as with the music mogul’s star in the Walk of Fame.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>He Joined The Voice Kids UK Before AGT</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Alfie’s YouTube channel</a>, the young artist began singing at 18 months old. Backed up by his supportive mom, people started noticing through his singing videos online. Aside from YouTube, Alfie is also a busker, so he can typically be seen performing in streets of Liverpool and Manchester.</p><p>In 2022, he tried his chance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Voice Kids UK</a>. Unfortunately, the odds were not in his favor during the Blind Auditions. On Facebook, Alfie’s mother narrated his short journey on the competition.</p><p>“Alfie sang Run to You by Whitney Houston and performed on the second day of filming with only 2 spaces left to try and win over 2 of the 4 celebrity coaches,” his mom wrote. “Although Alfie did amazing and was probably the proudest moment for us as parents, Alfie unfortunately didn’t get a turn.”</p><p>Nonetheless, despite this rejection, Alfie’s mom stated that such was still a “wonderful experience.” If anything, the situation has only given Alfie “more determination to do what he loves most, sing and perform.”</p><p>Now, Alfie has mustered enough courage to try again. This time, on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AGT</a>. To witness Alfie Andrew’s audition, be sure to tune in on the show tonight, at 8/7c on NBC.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_DrakeMilligan_Scott-DudelsonGetty-Images-for-Stagecoach-220x147.jpeg alt="Drake Milligan Says His Acting Experience Helped Him on ‘AGT’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Alfie Andrew</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZaSWuaa6056bZmliYsamrdFmpqWcXZfCtLfEq2SapJaesm6tzZ2pnq9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
