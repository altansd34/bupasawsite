This award show located in Nashville, TN recognizes some of the biggest names in the country music industry annually. Even though his time is up on <a href=#>Dancing With the Stars</a>, Jimmie walked the red carpet with his partner, Emma Slater, and won big.</strong></p><p>Even though Jimmie was eliminated Monday night on Dancing With the Stars, he has now won a greater prize of his own. The audience went wild as his name was announced for the prize. This country artist was in tears as he walked on stage to accept the award. He began his speech by thanking his deceased father for introducing him to country music.</p><p>“Five years ago, I spent my last $100 and came to the CMA Awards for the 50th to watch Charley Pride perform on stage,” Allen <a href=#>said</a>. “And I got to perform with him last year.”</p><p>He went on to thank his wife, his kids, his mom and of course, his manager who found him playing outside of a grocery store. Jimmie then went on to say everyone else in this category was amazing as well. Jimmie can no longer get the mirrorball, but he was able to get an award of his own in the same week as his elimination. We’re so happy to see this country star thriving in his industry.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-a-mini-american-idol-reunion-at-the-cmas>A Mini American Idol Reunion at The CMAS</h2><p>Jimmie Allen wasn’t the only familiar name in the 55th Country Music Awards headlines. This award show had a major line up of celebrities from <a href=#>American Idol</a>. Let’s start with the fact that Luke Bryan was the host of the show! He was the first solo host in 18 years so he made sure to have the other American Idol judges, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie alongside him on stage.</p><p>Other names from American Idol at this event were <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson</a>, Carrie Underwood, and former judge Keith Urban. It was great to see all three of these singers perform on the Country Music Awards stage last night. Other Idol contestants at this event were season 10 winner Scotty McCreery, season nine stand out Katie Stevens, and season 16’s lovebirds Gabby Barrett and Cade Foehner.</p><p>On top of the American Idol stars, there were also some huge names from <a href=#>The Voice</a> at this event. Blake Shelton and his battle advisor Dierks Bentley were seen at this country award ceremony. Last night Shelton performed his newest single “<a href=#>Come Back as a Country Boy</a>” on the Country Music Awards stage.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1350360115.jpg alt="Fans Are Loving Blake Shelton’s New ‘Come Back as a Country Boy’ Video" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaKkpqGVYq6tuMSnZLChnqh6r7HWZpirrJmowW67xWaroZ1drrKivoyaq2asmJp6pLvUp6ursV2iwrS1wmaYsJmimcBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
