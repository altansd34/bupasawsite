The “Super Bass” hitmaker recently opened up about how her three-year-old son Papa Bear is grasping what holidays are for.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nicki-minaj-says-papa-bear-knows-more-about-christmas-this-year>Nicki Minaj Says Papa Bear Knows More About Christmas This Year</h2><p>In a recent appearance on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Late Show with Stephen Colbert</a>, Minaj shared how having a kid changed how she views Christmas. According to the rapper, her toddler is now beginning to figure out the joy of the festive season.</p><p>“This year, I did see him being excited about the Christmas tree. So he understood a lot more now. But last year, he had all these gifts and just wanted to play with the boxes. He didn’t care about any of the gifts,” she <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p><p>On September 30, 2020, Minaj welcomed her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">baby boy</a> with husband Kenneth “Zoo” Petty. The rapstress nicknamed him Papa Bear.</p><p>In the interview, Minaj also talked how “resistant” Papa Bear is now.</p><p>“I keep telling people how strong he is. Like, he is so strong. I’ve never imagined that a baby could be strong. If he wants to push me, my body will move. He runs everything,” she said.</p><p>The “Super Freaky Girl” accounts Papa Bear’s strength to his screen time. Minaj revealed that her son has watched 2017 comedy film The Boss Baby, which has prompted him to channel the behavior of the movie’s suit-wearing, briefcase-carrying baby. Minaj went on, giving a shout out to parents and their efforts to take care of their kids.</p><p>“To everybody who have been parents for all these years, I don’t know how y’all did it. God bless y’all because I didn’t understand how in-depth [parenting] was, it never stops,” she said.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-engages-in-hilarious-rap-battle-with-stephen-colbert>She Engages in Hilarious Rap Battle with Stephen Colbert</h2><p>During the same guesting, Minaj traded some freestyle bars with the Emmy-winning host. Colbert, who’s always up for a rap challenge, didn’t display any signs of cold feet.</p><p>“High heels on for Stevie/ If I marry Stevie, he ain’t ever gon’ leave me,” she rapped, using a rhythm taken from her album Pink Friday 2’s “FTCU.”</p><p>Colbert then responded, “High heels or not, Nicki / You better hope you never meet my wife, Evie!”</p><p>This funny comeback surprised Minaj, prompting a few seconds of silence before she broke into laughter.</p><p>Pink Friday 2 is the rapper’s third no. 1 LP, making her the female rapper with the most chart-topping releases. It is Minaj’s fifth full-length studio album and the sequel to Pink Friday, her 2010 debut album. Yet, while the music collection has already been released, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">rapper</a> revealed that she’s “still working” on the album.</p><p>“I put more songs that entire week,” she said, referencing her 50 Cent-assisted “Beep Beep.” “My entire label looked like they were about to have heart attacks!”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Original_LionelRichie_KatyPerry_LukeBryan_ABC_Eric-McCandless-220x147.jpg alt="Behind The Scenes Look Into The Ongoing ‘American Idol’ Season 22 Hollywood Week" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>nicki minaj</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapKFdoravrclmnq6rmJrAbrvVnqlmoJWnerS7zWanmqiRYq%2BmrdFo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
