However, there’s one country in particular that is responsible for producing some real winners.&nbsp;In this list, we bring you the top ten best<a href=#> Filipino acts</a> from talent shows, ranked. Let us know if your favorite made the list!</strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-miss-tres>10. Miss Tres</h3><p>This fierce trio took the Britain’s Got Talent stage on series 12 and compared themselves to the likes of Destiny’s Child.&nbsp;Their performance of Tom Jones’s “Sex Bomb” definitely delivered the shock factor, and that’s exactly what they were going for. It’s safe to say, they surprised us all.&nbsp;</p><p>The deceivingly demure divas turned heads when their soft speaking voices transformed into baritone singing. The performance was fantastic and the judges sent Miss Tres on to the next round.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><br><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-alisah-bonaobra>9. Alisah Bonaobra</h3><p>This next singer had a whole lot of support from her community. It seems like she brought half of the Philippines with her to her audition. I can see why, this girl filled the entire room with her standout vocals. Back in 2017, Alisah Bonobra auditioned for the X Factor UK with Beyonce’s “Listen.” <a href=#>Nicole Scherzinger</a> was completely mesmerized by her performance and gave her a standing ovation in the end.&nbsp;Alisah was the sixth act to be eliminated in the competition, but still a star nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-dmx-comvale-oz>8. <strong>DMX Comvaleñoz</strong></h3><p>This all filipino dance crew took on The Champions of Britain’s Got Talent and&nbsp;delivered a little something for everyone.&nbsp;The tone they introduced to the audience made a total 180 by the end of the performance.&nbsp;The crew began with a heavy metal rock routine and dressed in all-black jumpsuits. Halfway through, the crew did a quick change into holographic mini dresses and wigs. They finished their choreography with a fun pop performance and had the whole audience on their feet.&nbsp;You could even spot a section in the audience dedicated to Filipino pride, as they proudly waved their country’s flag.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/UnUJE-BmkCI</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-upeepz>7. Upeepz</h3><p>On World of Dance, the sensational hip-hop group, Upeepz, brought some cultural flare in their semi-finals performance.&nbsp;They combined their modern style with traditional Filipino dances and costumes. It was a high energy performance that you couldn’t take your eyes off of.</p><p>The performance was filled with colors, energy, and passion. They didn’t make it to the final round of the competition, but the dance crew are already two-time world hip-hop dance champions.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/v6PZGDbUOH8</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-peter-rosalita>6. Peter Rosalita</h3><p>Now this name is probably the freshest in your mind. The ten-year-old shocked the judges this season on America’s Got Talent with his performance of Celine Dion’s “All By Myself.”&nbsp;His outfit was adorable as well. <a href=#>Peter Rosalita</a> stepped dapperly onto the stage in an all-white suit. He told the judges how nervous he was before he began to sing. Once we heard the first note, his nerves went out the window and he delivered a shocking performance.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-ellona-santiago>5. Ellona Santiago</h3><p>The 16-year-old powerhouse vocalist, took the stage on season two of the X Factor.&nbsp;She absolutely crushed her performance of “Wings” by Little Mix, a group who also rose to fame on the X Factor.&nbsp;Down the panel, each of the judges praised her spectacular performance. However, things got a little interesting by the time they reached Simon Cowell. Ellona asked the judge if she remembered her from season one, and he completely drew a blank. In the inaugural season of the X factor, she was placed in a group called Intensity. They unfortunately faced elimination in the top 12.&nbsp;She was ultimately given a second chance on the show and placed sixth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/zyuWxbVDGUo</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-4-tnt-boys>4. TNT Boys</h3><p>I know you guys are catching on by now, that the Philippines has the secret sauce when it comes to superstar vocals. The TNT Boys were featured on the short lived series The World’s Best.&nbsp;Like Bonaobra, this group also happened to cover&nbsp;“Listen” from Dream girls, and honestly, these boys gave Beyonce a her a run for her money.&nbsp;These singers were so good, that the show’s host, James Corden asked to join their group.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-angelica-hale>3. Angelica Hale</h3><p>This sweet, adorable singer auditioned for <a href=#>America’s Got Talent on season 1</a>2. The nine-year-old told the judges she wanted to be the next Whitney Houston, and auditioned&nbsp;with Andra Day’s “Rise up.” Angelica Hale received four yeses from the judges and was given the Golden Buzzer in the judge cuts round.&nbsp;She finished second in the competition becoming the youngest runner-up in the show’s history.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://youtu.be/b1NVOsatpF0</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-jessica-sanchez>2. Jessica Sanchez</h3><p><a href=#>Jessica Sanchez</a> was just 16-years-old when she auditioned for American Idol in 2012.&nbsp;Her voice was well beyond her years, and her cover of Whitney Houston’s “I Will Always Love You” earned a standing ovation from all three judges that season.&nbsp;Randy Jackson called her not only one of the best singers&nbsp;in the competition, but in the whole country.&nbsp;That’s a lot to live up to, but she did take the runner-up spot that season.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-marcelito-pomoy>1. Marcelito Pomoy</h3><p>I bet a lot of you reading were waiting to hear his name on the list. <a href=# class=broken_link>Marcelito Pomoy</a> took on AGT champions after winning Got Talent in the Philippines.&nbsp;In his audition he performed “The Prayer” the famous duet from Andrea Bocelli and Celine Dion.&nbsp;He impressively sang the song in both registers. Pomoy made it all the way to the finals that season. Though he didn’t take the win, he earned the title of highest placing foreign act on America’s Got Talent.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Masked-Singer-Raccoon-S5.jpeg alt="Remembering Danny Trejo’s ‘Wild’ Performances as The Raccoon on ‘The Masked Singer’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571p5kq5meoLKledOhnGasn6V6cnyMm5ysrF2btq21z6KlqGWRmMG0ecOoZLKnpWKuqL7EnmSwoaSderDB0WarqKhdmLWwtcKeZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
