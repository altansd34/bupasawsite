The Voice season 23 coach has just earned his third straight No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales chart as the music collection ranks first in the tally.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Niall Horan Earns Third No. 1 on Billboard’s Top Album Sales Chart</h2><p>The former <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a> band member is wasting no time in proving that he can shine solo. Serving as his third musical project, The Show has easily earned the no. 1 spot on the Billboard chart. Such milestone equaled the achievement of his former bandmate Harry Styles, who also had three solo albums to top the music sales charts.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Luminate, the album earned over 68,000 physical copies sold in the United States in the week ending June 15. In terms of digital album sales, The Show was able to sell 6,000 copies.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, it’s no surprise that The Show debuted at no. 1 on Billboard’s Vinyl Albums chart. During its first week, the music collection scored 33,700 vinyl format sales, the largest sales week for any vinyl album released by Capitol Records in the modern era.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet, while this feat is hard to obtain, Horan himself is no stranger to explosive accomplishments in the past. Back when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One Direction</a> still existed, the band secured four No. 1 albums before their unexpected disbandment.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-show-is-a-chill-sonic-adventure>The Show is a Chill Sonic Adventure</h2><p>Unlike his previous albums, The Show is relatively a short listen. Heartbreak Weather consists of 14 songs while his first album, Flicker featured 13. The Show is a 10-track music collection, a conscious decision for Niall Horan.</p><p>“All 10 songs have their special meanings to me and I hope they can all have meaning in your lives,” he wrote. “I made a 10 track album so hopefully you get to the end and want to go straight back to the start and do it all over again.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Show</a> is an effortlessly smooth and relaxed audio journey for its listeners. The album doesn’t necessarily require much energy and enthusiasm to be appreciated. Horan has perfectly created a laid-back audio adventure for his fans. Personally, I am fond of listening to “Meltdown” and “Never Grow Up.”</p><p>Currently, Horan is gearing up to embark on tour to further promote The Show. Admitting that he’s “eager” to hit the road, he said that he is expecting his upcoming concerts to be amazing.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Original_LeighAnnePinnock_Dave-BenettGetty-Images-for-Warner-Music-UK-LTD-220x147.jpeg alt="Former Little Mix Member Leigh-Anne Pinnock Drops First Solo Single “Don’t Say Love”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKYpaRdnbyzrc1mqpynoprAbsDHoqmdZaOpv6K1xqGrZqafYn5uu81mq6ioXZa5o8HMZqqapJWoeqS0wKurZq%2BZqbVuwMeeZKygn6x8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
