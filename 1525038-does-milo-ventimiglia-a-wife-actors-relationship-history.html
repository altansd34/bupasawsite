Most of them were also involved in show <a href=#>business</a>.</p><p class=align-left>For instance, he started dating the <i>Gilmore Girls</i> co-star <strong>Alexis Bledel</strong> in 2002. Their relationship lasted about three years when Alexis made it clear in 2016 that they were no longer together. Alexis <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Bledel said</a>,</p>I think everybody who has been dating for more than a couple of years probably talks about it (marriage) at some point. It's a fun thing for us to talk about, but that's it.<p class=align-left>After the actor’s break up with Alexis Bledel, the actor <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">started dating</a> <strong>Hayden Panettiere</strong>. Milo Ventimiglia’s girlfriend, Hayden, was a co-star in <i>The Heroes</i>. The duo was together since 2007 and parted ways in 2009.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ec5391469c36bde2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Amariah Morales, jay kinda funny (jay all day)’s girlfriend</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After Panettiere, Ventimiglia <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">was involved with</a> Jordana Brewster's sister, <strong>Isabella Brewster</strong>, a talent agent. The two have been spotted in Santa Monica and Disneyland enjoying their time together back in 2009-2010. A few years later, Isabella started seeing Russel Brand, which meant that her relationship with Milo came to a close.</p><p class=align-left>Milo was also rumoured to be dating the marketing coordinator for Stella McCartney, <strong>Kelly Egarian</strong>, in 2016. The two had several public outings but have not been seen together since 2017.</p><p class=align-left>The latest rumour surrounding the love life of Milo was in 2019 when he was caught spending time with the <a href=#>American actress </a><strong>Diane Guerrero</strong>. Most of the movie star’s fans believed that the duo had a thing, especially after they were spotted having a lunch date in Escuela Taqueria, a Mexican restaurant in Beverly Hills.

In 2021, the actor alluded to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> being single</a> and focusing on his career.</p>Everything is second position to work — everything… I've had friendships and relationships that definitely had a hard time with that. I'd get home from work and a girlfriend would want to spend time together, and I'd have to make sure I did spend time with her, sit down and eat, maybe turn on a movie for 20 minutes. But when my bowl is empty, I've got to go into my office and close the door and work for another two hours so my lines are spot on, and I'm ready to be on set the next day.<h4>Is Milo Ventimiglia married?</h4><p class=align-left>No, the American actor is not married, as he is focusing on his career. However, he had an interview with People in 2019, where he gave out his perspective regarding his take on marriage. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">actor said</a>,</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/521323ba827c68a2.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Yellz0’s biography: age, real name, boyfriend, net worth</span></p></a>I’m sure I’ll be a father when I’m meant to be a father. If I never have kids, then I was never meant to have kids as well. I think there’s a societal norm where you get married, you have a family, you raise a family, you pass on yourself to that family. Then you pass on.<h3>Is Milo Ventimiglia gay?</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=#>American television actor</a> has been rumoured to be gay, but these rumours remain just allegations as he has never confirmed them.
