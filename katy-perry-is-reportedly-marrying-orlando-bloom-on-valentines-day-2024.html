Now, Perry and Orlando see 2024 as the perfect year to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tie the knot</a>, a source from Heat reported.</p><p>“Katy and Orlando have postponed their wedding multiple times, but 2024 is the year they want to make it happen,” the insider <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>. “They’re happier than ever and everyone is predicting they’ll get married soon – possibly even on Valentine’s Day, which is the anniversary of their engagement.”</p><p>It’s true that Perry’s 2023 left her jam-packed, having dealt with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Idol</a> and her Las Vegas residency. Nonetheless, the insider said the singer and Bloom didn’t leave their wedding plans behind. The lovely pair apparently considered marrying in Japan, but they realized the logistics would be difficult.</p><p>“Doing something closer to home in California makes a lot more sense. Their place in Montecito has nine acres, so there’s plenty of room to do it there. Plus, it’s close to LA, so all of their showbiz friends could easily attend,” the source said.</p><p>Perry and Bloom initially met in 2016 during the Golden Globe Awards. They then dated for less than a year before breaking up in 2017. Despite split though, the pair remained friends until they got together in 2018.</p><p>On Valentine’s Day 2019, the Pirates of the Caribbean actor proposed to the “Roar” hitmaker. Over a year later, the couple welcomed their first child together, Daisy Dove Bloom.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-couple-is-allegedly-trying-for-another-baby>The Couple is Allegedly Trying For Another Baby</h2><p>According to the same source, the couple is also eyeing to have another baby this year. With that plan at play, it’s thus possible that Perry will be a “pregnant bride.”</p><p>“It’s no secret that she very much wants to have baby number two, and this year really makes the most sense. She’s finished her big Las Vegas residency, so she’s got some time in her schedule,” the source said. “Plus, at three, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daisy</a> is old enough now to understand the whole thing. She’s ready to be a big sister, too.”</p><p>Seemingly, the two have envisioned 2024 to be the year to further strengthen their family bond. Lately, Bloom and Perry had reportedly been enjoying lots of romantic dates.</p><p>“Having Daisy has totally united them – they’re more in love now than they’ve ever been,” the source said. “At this point, Katy’s staying pretty tight-lipped about their plans, but her friends are all saying this will be the year they make it official.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_DragRaceAllStars_KeyArt-220x147.png alt="‘RuPaul’s Drag Race UK vs. the World’ Teases The Series 2 Queens" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57ypqrsmWgmr%2BzxYyiqmaqlaW8s8DEnaOyZZ2Wv7PFyKeeZqeioa6vsM5mmaWnn6J6sLqMr5ilnZ6ptq%2Bx0mabmrFdZ31zgI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
