Recent <a href=#>YouGov research</a> conducted in July found that two-thirds of the British population oppose the privatisation of the Royal Mail, with just over one-third (36%) stating that they “strongly oppose” the policy.</p><p>The government believes that privatisation is necessary in order to innovate and improve the postal service. Furthermore, Moya Green, chief executive of Royal Mail, has stated that privatisation was inevitable and urged the unions to come to an agreement.</p><p>Using YouGov’s social media analysis tool, SoMA, we can see the significant impact of this announcement on Twitter.</p><p>More people heard about Royal Mail on Twitter on 12 September (51% of UK users) than on any other day in the last four months.</p><p>This includes Royal Mail’s reach on 28 May when it announced <a href=#>soaring profits </a>(26.2%) and on 12 July when <a href=#>Vince Cable</a> announced that Royal Mail employees were to receive free shares, which meant that 45.9% of UK Twitter users heard about the brand.</p><img _ngcontent-yg-app-c2171288495 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ygo-assets-websites-editorial-emea.yougov.net/images/royal20mail.format-webp.webp alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>SoMA is unique in its ability to offer insight into exactly what demographic audiences heard about the Royal Mail on 12 September.
