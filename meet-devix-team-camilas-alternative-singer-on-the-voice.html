The 28-year-old singer turned three chairs in his Blind Audition and won both his Battle and his Knockout, showing off a cool style and an effortless voice.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-star-devix-has-been-performing-from-a-young-age>The Voice Star Devix Has Been Performing from a Young Age</h2><p>Devix (whose real name is Eric Torres) is originally from Queens, New York. He shared in his Blind Audition that his mother has cerebral palsy, and she unfortunately couldn’t make it there to be with him. Devix is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one of five kids</a>, and both of his brothers are also into music.</p><p>From a young age, Devix learned several instruments including piano and drums. He’s been gigging since he was around 18 years old, and he came up with his stage name from a video game character he created. Devix currently lives and performs in York, Pennsylvania.</p><p>In addition to performing live, Devix also posts covers and original songs on his Instagram and YouTube accounts. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">local news</a>, the singer also hosted livestreams from his garage at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>In his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>Instagram</a> bio, Devix describes himself as an “Alternative/indie Singer-Songwriter.” After performing “Heat Waves” by Glass Animals in his Blind Audition, he shared that some of his other favorite artists are Foals and Daughter.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘THE VOICE’ ASKS VIEWERS TO CONTRIBUTE TO UPCOMING FAN WEEK SHOW</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-is-headed-to-the-live-playoffs>The Singer Is Headed to the Live Playoffs</h2><p>John Legend, Camila Cabello, and Gwen Stefani all turned around for Devix’s Blind Audition. Stefani told the singer that his voice has “personality and style,” while Legend described it as “magic,” calling him a male version of Stefani herself.</p><p>“I feel like I’m missing somebody like you on my team,” Cabello told Devix. “I’m looking for somebody that is alternative indie with a pop sensibility.”</p><p>Devix chose to join Cabello’s team. In the Battles, he went up against Sasha Hurtado on a duet of MGMT’s “Electric Feel.” Cabello chose him as the winner, keeping him on her team. Later, in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three-way Knockouts</a>, Devix took on Andrew Igbokidi and Steven McMorran, once again keeping his spot in the competition with his performance of “Yellow” by Coldplay.</p><p>Now Devix is continuing in the competition on Team Camila, heading into the Live Playoffs, which kick off Monday night on NBC.
