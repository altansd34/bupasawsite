The Addams Family is&nbsp;the perfect example. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;series full of&nbsp;dark humor, featuring a&nbsp;family of&nbsp;eccentric millionaires who enjoyed the most exotic things in&nbsp;life.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> gathered several little-known facts about the popular series to&nbsp;relive somehow those moments we&nbsp;spent in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV laughing with our whole family.</p><p><h2>1. The TV&nbsp;series was based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cartoon from <i>The New Yorker</i>.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d21/dfd/16e88d57cab87fc53bec49fcea.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Addams Family</i></a> was first broadcasted in&nbsp;1964. It&nbsp;was based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cartoon created by&nbsp;cartoonist Charles Addams, which appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i> from 1938 to&nbsp;1964. From its origin, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;satire of&nbsp;the ideal family of&nbsp;the twentieth century: a&nbsp;wealthy aristocratic family that showed the macabre side of&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;addition to&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series, this idea also inspired movies, video games, books, and music. It&nbsp;soon became a&nbsp;significant influence on&nbsp;pop culture.</p><p><h2>2. The characters did not have a&nbsp;name until they appeared on&nbsp;TV.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/05d/f2b/30dc9855bd81083da5cb16dcf3.jpg><p>The characters did not have names when they appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New Yorker</i>. They were named by&nbsp;the producers of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV series. For the patriarch of&nbsp;the family, the creator of&nbsp;the original cartoons suggested the name <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gomez</a>. His wife was named Morticia.</p><p>The eldest son was called Pugsley, and for the daughter’s name, Charles Addams suggested “Wednesday” based on&nbsp;a&nbsp;children’s rhyme. Their butler Lurch, Uncle Fester, Grandma Eudora, and Thing were other important characters.</p><p><h2>3. Gomez Addams’ look changed a&nbsp;lot.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d8a/fb3/7253685e109e633b96b9a42baa.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the original cartoon, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Gomez</a> was chubby and had a&nbsp;snub nose, crooked teeth, and a&nbsp;receding chin. He&nbsp;looked nothing like the actor who portrayed him, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>John Astin</a>, who was well known at&nbsp;the time, having starred in&nbsp;many films.</p><p>John was given full creative freedom to&nbsp;develop his character, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;would bring ideas to&nbsp;the producers, who would accept and defend them when the network owners would decline them. One of&nbsp;his ideas was to&nbsp;make Gomez attractive, a&nbsp;“Latin lover,” because that was the prototype of&nbsp;the leading man at&nbsp;the time.</p><p><h2>4. It&nbsp;took 2&nbsp;hours every day to&nbsp;apply Morticia’s make-up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4f1/2f6/3c05055e16b51712d73b8fdca9.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Carolyn Jones</a>, who played Morticia, was an&nbsp;actress who had worked with celebrities such as&nbsp;Alfred Hitchcock, Elvis Presley, and others. For her role in&nbsp;<i>The Addams Family,</i> she was extensively <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>made up</a>&nbsp;and wore a&nbsp;wig made of&nbsp;natural hair, as&nbsp;her hair was blonde and not so&nbsp;long and straight. During the series’ two seasons, she also played Lady Fingers and her character’s twin sister, Ophelia Frump.</p><p><h2>5. Lurch could not speak initially.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/905/d78/e7c41f5997b4b9209990eb973e.jpg><p>Originally, Lurch was just going to&nbsp;grunt. But during the filming of&nbsp;the first episode, Ted Cassidy, the actor playing the butler known for his height and deep bass voice, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>improvised</a> the catchphrase “You rang?” when the family rang the bell. The producers loved that and added short, repetitive phrases to&nbsp;his character in&nbsp;each episode.</p><p><h2>6. The actor who played Uncle Fester shaved his head to&nbsp;get the role.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd8/7c4/0065eb5bb28312a2ee055b6d55.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Jackie Coogan</a> was initially turned down for the role of&nbsp;Uncle Fester, but after arriving home from the audition, he&nbsp;shaved his hair, created his own costume and <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a>, and returned to&nbsp;the casting. In&nbsp;the end, he&nbsp;landed the role. Coogan had a&nbsp;long acting career in&nbsp;Hollywood, having acted since childhood. One of&nbsp;his most memorable roles was that of&nbsp;the boy who accompanied Charles Chaplin in&nbsp;<i>The Kid</i>, his 1921&nbsp;classic.</p><p><h2>7. The Thing was Ted Cassidy’s hand.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/21b/c98/d5d09d5a82aada9d1778b19d67.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>The Thing</a>, the hand that helped the family in&nbsp;their daily chores, was played by&nbsp;the same actor who played Lurch. It&nbsp;was actually his right hand, although Ted used to&nbsp;switch hands now and then to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;anyone noticed. In&nbsp;the series, you also got to&nbsp;see his whole arm when, for example, he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;reach for something outside his box. In&nbsp;episode&nbsp;23, producers revealed that the full name of&nbsp;the hand was Thing T. Thing.</p><p><h2>8. It&nbsp;was the first family in&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV series to&nbsp;own a&nbsp;computer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/7ef/ec9/8d4a8d5559ada96139c7da4e63.png><p>In&nbsp;one episode, Gomez wants to&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;vacation to&nbsp;the moon, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;uses his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>personal computer</a> to&nbsp;calculate how much it&nbsp;costs to&nbsp;make the trip. It&nbsp;does the mathematical operation and, in&nbsp;the end, comes up&nbsp;with the sum of&nbsp;one billion and 21.30&nbsp;USD.</p><p><h2>9. The Addams family was very wealthy.</h2></p><p><i>The Addams Family</i> was a&nbsp;parody of&nbsp;eccentric millionaires with very exotic tastes. According to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Forbes magazine <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>analysis</a>, Gomez Addams was a&nbsp;descendant of&nbsp;Castilian royalty and British aristocrats. He&nbsp;was also a&nbsp;very lucky man, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;invested money by&nbsp;buying a&nbsp;swamp that was later discovered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;important oil field. In&nbsp;addition, he&nbsp;acquired a&nbsp;mummified hand in&nbsp;a&nbsp;market that turned out to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;priceless Egyptian antiquity.</p><p>Thanks to&nbsp;that, he&nbsp;owned an&nbsp;insurance company, a&nbsp;salt mine, a&nbsp;tombstone factory, and a&nbsp;vulture farm. If&nbsp;you add it&nbsp;all&nbsp;up, his fortune amounted to&nbsp;2&nbsp;billion USD.</p><p><h2>10. Gomez and Morticia were really in&nbsp;love.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpeg/e1b/aa0/1c7d4b5992b4cf9958258a3d55.jpeg><p>In&nbsp;a&nbsp;2018&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>, John Astin, the actor who played Gomez, admitted that he&nbsp;and Carolyn Jones (Morticia) were attracted to&nbsp;each other from the start and that this helped their relationship look more natural on&nbsp;screen. The two <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;give their characters a&nbsp;“big romance” as&nbsp;an&nbsp;antidote to&nbsp;the bland couples seen in&nbsp;TV sitcoms at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>Even&nbsp;so, although Gomez <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kissed</a> Morticia on&nbsp;her arm and spoke to&nbsp;her in&nbsp;French, he&nbsp;never kissed her on&nbsp;the lips.</p><p><h2>11. Cousin Itt did not appear in&nbsp;the original cartoon.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/20e/d0d/a73b0b54b9b30d152f495c7e21.png><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cousin Itt</a> was one of&nbsp;the characters created for the&nbsp;TV series. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;short being covered with hair who spoke in&nbsp;a&nbsp;language only the family could understand. In&nbsp;one episode, they had him learn to&nbsp;talk more slowly and understandably. Still, he&nbsp;became petulant and obnoxious, so&nbsp;Morticia made him angry to&nbsp;get him back to&nbsp;talking fast again.</p><p>He&nbsp;was part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>list</a> that included many cousins who were mentioned during the series and never appeared, but who gave the idea that Gomez’s family was enormous.</p><p><h2>12. The Addams had an&nbsp;eternal rivalry with the Munsters.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2d9/36c/f9fbcf5a768c36073923525ef5.jpg><p>Since its premiere in&nbsp;1964, the series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>competed</a> against <i>The Munsters</i>, which premiered a&nbsp;week apart, but was always down in&nbsp;the ratings compared to&nbsp;its competitor. Two years later, when <i>The Munsters</i> was canceled. Then <i>The Addams Family </i>was also canceled.</p><p><h2>13. We&nbsp;saw them again in&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;really successful films.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cfd/568/23640c516e89402bd334bf9c62.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1991, director Barry Sonnenfeld and the creators of&nbsp;<i>Men in&nbsp;Black</i> made a&nbsp;modern adaptation of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Addams Family</i></a> with the same tone of&nbsp;black humor but focused on&nbsp;the present day. The main roles were played by&nbsp;Raúl Juliá (Gomez), Anjelica Huston (Morticia), Christopher Lloyd (Cousin Itt), and Christina Ricci (Morticia). The film was a&nbsp;critical and box office success, and a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;years later, the sequel was released, where Morticia had another son.</p><p><h2>14. They will return in&nbsp;2022.</h2></p><p>In&nbsp;late 2021&nbsp;it was announced that renowned director Tim Burton was working on&nbsp;a&nbsp;series based on&nbsp;the Addams Family characters but focusing on&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Wednesday</a>. It’s supposed to&nbsp;premiere in&nbsp;fall 2022, with actress Jenna Ortega in&nbsp;the lead role. She will play a&nbsp;now teenage, almost adult Wednesday. At&nbsp;the same time, the new <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Munsters</i></a> movie, directed by&nbsp;Rob Zombie, will be&nbsp;released around the same time, reviving the 1964&nbsp;rivalry.</p><p>What episode do&nbsp;you remember the most from the series?
