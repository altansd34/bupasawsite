Currently, Carey is recognized as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling</a> female artist of all time, having sold more than 200 million albums throughout her career.</p><p>In a 2020 interview, Carey discussed why Christmas is such a special time for her. She considers the holiday season as the only time she’s able to “breathe for a second.”</p><p>“After I kind of emerged from my first relationship-slash-marriage, I created the Christmases that I wanted to have.” Carey said. “A lot of very bad stuff happened to me when I was 12. But also, there is the spirit of that kid, that fighter who doesn’t give up, even though the world didn’t understand that from my point of view.”</p><p>Carey added her troubled <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">childhood</a> to further explain that her love for the holiday extends all the way back to her roots. As the “sad kid that wanted Christmas to be great,” Carey is definitely successful in delivering a memorable Christmas to all.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Laci-new-photo-credit-Joshua-Kim-copy-220x275.jpeg alt="‘American Idol’s Laci Kaye Booth Releases New Song ‘Damn Good in a Dive Bar’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>mariah carey</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5707CmZqSlmLi6ecyaqaKZmGKwor7EsmSfmZ6oeri1y6Vkm51dlq%2BtsYytpmarpJbGbq3TZp%2Beql2jxqR5z56lraCfqsCmecWoqWannqHGbn6PZmhyZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
