This song is the theme song of Full House. “Everywhere You Look” is also the theme song of the 2016 spin off series, Fuller House.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bianca-ryan-shares-touching-tribute-to-full-house-s-bob-saget>Bianca Ryan Shares Touching Tribute to Full House‘s Bob Saget</h2><p>Plenty of people have paid tribute to the television dad through social media posts, but Bianca’s was a bit different. Instead of sharing an image of the actor/comedian, she shared a video of herself singing the theme song of the series. Along with the video the America’s Got Talent winner shared shared that the lyrics of the song have a different meaning now.</p><p>Within the video, Bianca is playing the piano for this tune. The slowed down pace to this song definitely gives the tune a different feel. If this cover of the song were playing behind videos of Saget, it would be enough to jerk tears for some fans of the series.</p><p>“RIP&nbsp;#BobSaget Watching Full House&nbsp;was a huge part of my childhood. While I was recording this I realized how much these lyrics hit differently now,” Bianca wrote.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>“Everywhere You Look” Takes on New Meaning</h2><p>Fans of Bianca flooded the comment section of this video. People in the comment section were quick to comment on the angelic aspect to this cover. Bianca had recorded back tracking with multiple harmonies to achieve this end result and it really paid off.</p><p>“That was beautiful. What an amazing tribute. I grew up watching re run after re run of Full House and I never got tired of it,” a fan commented on Instagram. “I love Fuller House too. Rip Danny”</p><p>The fans of this AGT winner shared that her angelic tone was what made this tribute so beautiful. Many of them shared that they were able to get goosebumps from her voice.</p><p><a href=#>Bob Saget</a> passed away passed away suddenly in his room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando after a comedy show.
