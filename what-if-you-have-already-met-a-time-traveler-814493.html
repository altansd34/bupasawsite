He’s a&nbsp;cyborg who came to&nbsp;us from the year 2050 to&nbsp;stop the coming end of&nbsp;the world. In&nbsp;2020, he&nbsp;appeared on&nbsp;a&nbsp;TV show where he&nbsp;said the whole world was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>inside the matrix</u></a>. Then he&nbsp;hit the headlines and gave an&nbsp;interview to&nbsp;a&nbsp;popular YouTube channel.</p><p>As&nbsp;proof that he’s a&nbsp;cyborg, he&nbsp;demonstrated his robotic voice, which can be&nbsp;made in&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple computer program. And he&nbsp;also called himself “we” because he&nbsp;declared himself a&nbsp;collective consciousness that had come to&nbsp;save humanity. Orrin became famous for his predictions about the near future, but it&nbsp;turned out that many experts had already announced these forecasts earlier.</p><p>He&nbsp;also said that a&nbsp;huge corporation was suppressing humanity, and we&nbsp;were inside a&nbsp;complex computer simulation. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;don’t improve or&nbsp;care for each other and nature, the end will begin in&nbsp;2050. Orrin no&nbsp;longer appears on&nbsp;major shows, but he&nbsp;has a&nbsp;small fanbase of&nbsp;people who love all sorts of&nbsp;fantastic theories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/71e/c8e/d61f8857678471965b7e5b39ef.png><p>Another time traveler <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>is&nbsp;Adam Archon</u></a>, who came to&nbsp;us from 2045. There was an&nbsp;interview with him on&nbsp;YouTube, where he&nbsp;shared some details about the future of&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, after which the video went viral and hit the lines in&nbsp;many newspapers. Archon reported that the last official president of&nbsp;the country would be&nbsp;the daughter of&nbsp;Martin Luther King III&nbsp;— Yolanda Renee King, and she would become the greatest&nbsp;US president in&nbsp;history.</p><p>Another exciting event that Archon announced is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;2028. He&nbsp;said that people would learn about the existence of&nbsp;extraterrestrial civilizations. He&nbsp;added that these creatures wouldn’t come from outer space. The traveler also noted that the world would switch to&nbsp;a&nbsp;single digital currency, and all cash would disappear.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, no&nbsp;one believed him, so&nbsp;the experts conducted a&nbsp;lie detector test. And Adam Archon successfully passed&nbsp;it. He&nbsp;said that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;chip in&nbsp;his hand to&nbsp;facilitate time travel; an&nbsp;extraterrestrial civilization would arrive on&nbsp;Earth in&nbsp;2028, and in&nbsp;2045 people would be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;robots.</p><p>The lie detector didn’t state that Archon was lying. But this doesn’t mean he&nbsp;told the truth since the device can be&nbsp;deceived with the help of&nbsp;special training. In&nbsp;any case, in&nbsp;2028, we&nbsp;will find out whether Archon was right or&nbsp;not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b7e/3b3/d9930a5f69ba4fcadee8fc9e7f.png><p>All these time travelers arrive in&nbsp;the past and, for some reason, don’t use knowledge from the future. What would you do&nbsp;if&nbsp;you could go&nbsp;back 50&nbsp;years? Perhaps, you would invest money in&nbsp;shares of&nbsp;some young company that will become a&nbsp;big expensive corporation. In&nbsp;that case, everyone would believe that you really came from the past.</p><p>And by&nbsp;the way, one guy did&nbsp;it! He&nbsp;invested $800 in&nbsp;the stock exchange and made $350 million out of&nbsp;it! This guy’s name was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Andrew Carlssin</u></a>. And he&nbsp;hit a&nbsp;big jackpot in&nbsp;2003. However, he&nbsp;didn’t manage to&nbsp;enjoy a&nbsp;rich life because the FBI came for him.</p><p>Andrew sold some stocks and bought others and did this very successfully. Thus, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;few months, he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;millionaire. The Securities Commission couldn’t believe in&nbsp;such coincidences, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;called the FBI. During the interrogation, everyone was sure Andrew would begin to&nbsp;justify himself and say he&nbsp;was lucky. But instead, he&nbsp;calmly replied that he&nbsp;came from the year 2256 with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;time machine.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/d46/9a5/5f04a355f08b723cd305892f0e.png><p>Of&nbsp;course, no&nbsp;one took it&nbsp;seriously. But when the FBI started looking for information about this man, they found nothing. Andrew Carlssin had no&nbsp;documents. He&nbsp;was not in&nbsp;any database. He&nbsp;just appeared out of&nbsp;nowhere and started making a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money. He&nbsp;was interrogated for about 4&nbsp;hours, and he&nbsp;behaved pretty calmly.</p><p>It&nbsp;seemed as&nbsp;if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was telling the truth. However, he&nbsp;didn’t tell them the time machine’s location. When the press found out about this man, he&nbsp;immediately became a&nbsp;celebrity. Well-known news sites began to&nbsp;write about Andrew Carlssin. Articles have appeared in&nbsp;Japan, Australia, Germany, the&nbsp;UK, and other countries.</p><p>And, of&nbsp;course, journalists started calling the FBI to&nbsp;find out more details about this guy. And the FBI told them that the whole story was fiction and that there was no&nbsp;Andrew Carlssin. Information about him appeared on&nbsp;an&nbsp;Internet resource known for its fake news. At&nbsp;some point, the article about the time traveler somehow got into Yahoo, where it&nbsp;went viral. So, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;see, all statements about time travelers are either fiction or&nbsp;a&nbsp;lie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/10d/601/db6ff95606809700dccf494beb.png><p>Conversations about such travels appeared thanks to&nbsp;fantastic films and books. Pop culture has greatly influenced this fantastic concept and created several theories claiming that time travel is&nbsp;real. And some people believe that. Especially those who are far from science.</p><p>But what do&nbsp;real scientists think about this? <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>Are such trips really impossible</u></a>? Let’s try to&nbsp;find out. Scientists say “yes”&nbsp;— time travel is&nbsp;real because we&nbsp;are now traveling in&nbsp;time. Time is&nbsp;moving forward, and we&nbsp;are moving with&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;can call it&nbsp;a&nbsp;journey. But if&nbsp;we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;get into the future or&nbsp;go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the past, everything is&nbsp;much more complicated here.</p><p>Remember Einstein’s theory of&nbsp;relativity? It&nbsp;says that time moves relative to&nbsp;the observer and has no&nbsp;constant value. To&nbsp;understand better, here’s a&nbsp;simple example.&nbsp;10&nbsp;hairs on&nbsp;your head. Is&nbsp;it&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot or&nbsp;little? 10&nbsp;hairs in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bowl of&nbsp;soup. Is&nbsp;that a&nbsp;lot or&nbsp;little? Everything is&nbsp;relative and depends on&nbsp;the conditions.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/070/a35/6774bb5434a1134cff71143d65.png><p>The same thing happens with time and space. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;move at&nbsp;a&nbsp;tremendous speed, close to&nbsp;the speed of&nbsp;light, then time slows down for&nbsp;us. The perception of&nbsp;time becomes different for a&nbsp;person who’s running and for one who’s standing still. If&nbsp;we&nbsp;are near some heavy object, let’s say, a&nbsp;thousand times heavier than the Sun, then the time next to&nbsp;this object also slows down, thanks to&nbsp;its strong gravity.</p><p>In&nbsp;this sense, time travel is&nbsp;possible if&nbsp;you’re an&nbsp;old person and meet your friend as&nbsp;young as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was 50&nbsp;years ago. “Why are you so&nbsp;young?” “Oh, I’ve just been flying in&nbsp;space at&nbsp;a&nbsp;tremendous speed all this time, that’s all.” But this doesn’t mean that this friend just sat on&nbsp;the ship for 50&nbsp;years and didn’t age.</p><p>No, time was different for him.&nbsp;10&nbsp;years for you on&nbsp;Earth is&nbsp;a&nbsp;long period of&nbsp;time. But for him, these ten years passed like half an&nbsp;hour. Gravity and speed bend time. For this reason, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><u>astronaut Scott Kelly</u></a>, who spent a&nbsp;year and a&nbsp;half in&nbsp;orbit, became five milliseconds younger than his twin brother after coming to&nbsp;Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fde/efb/a1b0575174aefcdc21256e6e7c.png><p>All this time, Scott spent inside the ship flying in&nbsp;orbit at&nbsp;high speed, and he&nbsp;was also further away from the gravitational center of&nbsp;the planet. So, time was slower for him by&nbsp;five milliseconds than for his brother. Objectively, time always runs at&nbsp;the same speed, but its speed changes inside the perceptions of&nbsp;different observers under different conditions.</p><p>That’s what the theory of&nbsp;relativity is&nbsp;about. But what about jumping into the future or&nbsp;the past, like in&nbsp;movies? Wormholes will help you with this. This is&nbsp;something like tunnels that pass through space and time and can connect different time segments in&nbsp;different places in&nbsp;the universe.</p><p>They are like cheat codes that can break the laws of&nbsp;the universe. Wormholes are elusive, have different sizes, are unpredictable, appear in&nbsp;space, and vanish. But their main problem is&nbsp;that wormholes exist only in&nbsp;theory and sci-fi and have never been noticed in&nbsp;our universe by&nbsp;scientists.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSprdNmoJ9lqaTCbrTAr5xmmZynsqKw2Gaknqxdlnq1tcyeZK2qkauyrbHRZm9qbGRugHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
