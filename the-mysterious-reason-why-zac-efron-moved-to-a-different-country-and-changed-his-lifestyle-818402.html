Despite this, his parents were never involved in&nbsp;the entertainment business. Still, he&nbsp;took his first steps into that world early on&nbsp;in&nbsp;his life. His journey in&nbsp;acting and singing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>began</a> during his time at&nbsp;Arroyo Grande High School in&nbsp;the early 2000s, with a&nbsp;drama teacher playing a&nbsp;pivotal role in&nbsp;connecting him to&nbsp;an&nbsp;agent.</p><p>After he&nbsp;achieved success with teen flicks like the<i> High School Musical</i> trilogy and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>17&nbsp;Again</i></a><i> </i>(2009), he&nbsp;shifted into more dramatic roles in&nbsp;films such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Greatest Showman</i></a><i> </i>(2017) and, more recently, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile</i></a><i> </i>(2019). It&nbsp;was this ever-growing filmography that allowed him to&nbsp;amass a&nbsp;net worth of&nbsp;around $25 million and allowed him to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>purchase</a> a&nbsp;mansion in&nbsp;Los Feliz, <a href=# title="Los Angeles" data-link=tag>Los Angeles</a>, in&nbsp;2013. He&nbsp;lived there for seven years until he&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer felt like it&nbsp;was the right place for him.</p><p>So, what happened to&nbsp;Zac Efron to&nbsp;make him change his mind? Keep reading to&nbsp;find out.</p><p><h2>His L.A. house had everything to&nbsp;offer, but ultimately it&nbsp;wasn’t enough.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/45c/123/378c0d5932a47a2673ae46b344.jpg><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>36-year-old</a> actor put his Los Feliz home up&nbsp;for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sale</a> in&nbsp;December 2020, and the listing made public the house’s astounding features. The property, which is&nbsp;nestled against the Hollywood Hills and located in&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prestigious neighborhood</a> filled with plenty of&nbsp;celebrity residents, offers breathtaking views, accentuated by&nbsp;walls of&nbsp;glass, terraces, and numerous outdoor spaces that offer panoramic vistas of&nbsp;the city below.</p><p>With five bedrooms and five bathrooms within its 5.455-square-foot layout, the main level <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>includes</a> a&nbsp;living area, dining room, chef’s kitchen adjoining a&nbsp;family room, and a&nbsp;master suite with a&nbsp;spa-like bathroom. But that’s not all!</p><p>Additionally, it&nbsp;has three bedrooms with bathrooms downstairs, along with a&nbsp;separate one-bedroom, one-bath guesthouse. It&nbsp;also features amenities such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;gym, media room, game room, and security cameras, and the outdoor space includes view decks suitable for outdoor dining and lounging.</p><p>So, with all its potential, it&nbsp;wasn’t shocking that it&nbsp;sold in&nbsp;only a&nbsp;few months, despite the hefty price tag. In&nbsp;May 2021, the house <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>sold</a> for $5.3&nbsp;million. Albeit below the initial asking price of&nbsp;$5.9&nbsp;million, it&nbsp;still marks a&nbsp;profitable venture for Efron, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;paid around $4&nbsp;million when he&nbsp;first purchased the property.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;fell in&nbsp;love with a&nbsp;different country.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c60/da1/3ce718508786cbe81f979b030a.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2020, Efron made a&nbsp;move that had a&nbsp;deep impact on&nbsp;him&nbsp;— he&nbsp;relocated to&nbsp;Byron Bay, <a href=# title=Australia data-link=tag>Australia</a>. Back then, he&nbsp;still owned the Los Feliz mansion, so&nbsp;many thought it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;temporary home. The fact that he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lived</a> out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>van</a>, before buying a&nbsp;property in&nbsp;the Australian beachside town also led many to&nbsp;believe nothing much could come of&nbsp;the move.</p><p>However, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shot</a> the second season of&nbsp;his <a href=# title=Netflix data-link=tag>Netflix</a> documentary series <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Down to&nbsp;Earth</i></a><i> </i>there, which allowed him to&nbsp;spend over a&nbsp;year with the Aussies. Eventually, he&nbsp;did <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>return</a> to&nbsp;the&nbsp;US to&nbsp;enjoy quality time with his family, but it&nbsp;wasn’t long before he&nbsp;was once again on&nbsp;Australian ground. This time, it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;shoot <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Ricky Stanicky</i></a>, a&nbsp;movie in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;co-stars with John Cena and that has yet to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;set date for its debut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcf/554/d54e8b513581e3f9d76e6f5057.jpg><p>But a&nbsp;special situation might have sealed the deal for his ever-growing bond with the country. Shortly after he&nbsp;moved to&nbsp;Australia, Efron found love. He&nbsp;met <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Vanessa Valladares</a>, a&nbsp;waitress at&nbsp;the Byron Bay General Store &&nbsp;Cafe, in&nbsp;June 2020. They began <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>dating</a> and eventually spent Christmas and New Year’s together in&nbsp;Australia. Although the couple has since <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>called it&nbsp;quits</a>, the relationship might have been the final trigger of&nbsp;Efron’s decision to&nbsp;move permanently from the&nbsp;US, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;then put his L.A. home on&nbsp;the market.</p><p>Finally, a&nbsp;source close to&nbsp;the actor revealed in&nbsp;January 2021, that Efron already considered Australia «home.»</p><p><h2>The actor doesn’t think Hollywood is&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy place to&nbsp;live&nbsp;in.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c27/3c2/efa0345ac78acb23c0a7f39b73.jpg><p>The actor had previously expressed his intention to&nbsp;move out of&nbsp;Hollywood, though, and it&nbsp;was precisely in&nbsp;a&nbsp;scene from <i>Down to&nbsp;Earth</i>. In&nbsp;the fourth episode, he&nbsp;candidly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shared</a> his desire to&nbsp;move away from the Hollywood scene and the lifestyle associated with&nbsp;it, and emphasized that it&nbsp;didn’t contribute in&nbsp;any way to&nbsp;a&nbsp;«long, happy, mentally-sound life.»</p><p>Curiously, what happened to&nbsp;Zac Efron also happened to&nbsp;Chris Hemsworth, in&nbsp;which both actors decided to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;Australia so&nbsp;they could distance themselves from the hecticness of&nbsp;Hollywood. Although Hemsworth himself is&nbsp;Australian, his mindset was similar to&nbsp;that of&nbsp;Efron.</p><p>In&nbsp;2016, Hemsworth, known for his role as&nbsp;Thor in&nbsp;several Marvel movies, relocated his family from Los Angeles to&nbsp;Byron Bay. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>40-year-old</a> similarly expressed a&nbsp;wish to&nbsp;escape the suffocating nature of&nbsp;being constantly surrounded by&nbsp;the entertainment industry. Opting for a&nbsp;more tranquil lifestyle, as&nbsp;of&nbsp;2023, he&nbsp;and his family reside in&nbsp;a&nbsp;$20 million mega-mansion in&nbsp;Byron Bay’s hinterland, which they view as&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthier environment for their children to&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;in.</p><p>Zac Efron isn’t the only celebrity who decided to&nbsp;move to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new home. Many others did as&nbsp;well, and they spared no&nbsp;expenses to&nbsp;buy the luxury house of&nbsp;their dreams.
