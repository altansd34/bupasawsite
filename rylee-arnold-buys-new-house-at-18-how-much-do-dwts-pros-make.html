The dancer recently shared the exciting news on social media, prompting fans to wonder just how much the show’s pros are paid.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dwts-pro-rylee-arnold-buys-new-house-at-18>DWTS Pro Rylee Arnold Buys New House at 18</h2><p>Earlier this week, Arnold announced on Instagram that she had bought a house, writing that she was “feeling so so grateful.” She shared a few photos in which she poses on the kitchen counter and leaning against the fireplace.</p><p>Arnold also posted a quick <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">video on TikTok</a> in which she can be seen signing the closing documents for the house and entering through the front door. In one clip, she spins around in the empty living room. In <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">another video</a>, Arnold shares her ideas for decorating the new space.</p><p>Fans were wondering if Arnold’s new house is in California or her home state of Utah. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heavy</a>, it appears that the property is in Utah. The dancer’s older sister, former DWTS pro Lindsay Arnold, also lives in Utah with her husband and kids.</p><p>Some fans were also shocked by the idea that the 18-year-old, who has only competed on one season of the show, could afford to buy a house. As <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>one fan wrote</a> on Reddit, “I am so curious to know how much DWTS cast members make.”</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HARRY JOWSEY EXPLAINS WHY HE GAVE RYLEE ARNOLD A $15K VAN CLEEF BRACELET</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-much-do-the-show-s-pro-dancers-make>How Much Do the Show’s Pro Dancers Make?</h2><p>Although DWTS has not officially revealed how much the celebrity contestants and pro dancers make for appearing on the show, there have been reports about the estimated amount. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" class=broken_link>Parade</a> looked into the rumored salaries last December.</p><p>The starting salary for celebrities on the show is reportedly $125,000 — with a bonus of $10,000 per week if they make it to the third and fourth weeks. The bonuses apparently get bigger the longer they stay, up to $50,000 for making it to the Semifinals and Finals.</p><p>That means the competing stars could make up to $360,000 for appearing on the show. However, one report stated that pay was cut in 2019, capping it at $295,000. Pro dancers, on the other hand, reportedly make less than the stars they dance with.</p><p>The rumored starting salary for pros is $1,600 per episode. Pros who have been on the show longer can apparently negotiate a higher paycheck, up to $5,200 per episode. The cap is apparently $100,000 for pros per season.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Original_KatyPerry_DisneyEric-McCandless-220x147.jpeg alt="Why Katy Perry Called Her Fans ‘Traitors’ on This Week’s ‘American Idol’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Rylee Arnold</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570bKjnp1dlr%2Bvu8udZJutqah6r7HWZp%2BoraOaeqLAjGpvZqCfrHquwcKhZJ2nXZnEtb%2BMqamoq12irqyxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
