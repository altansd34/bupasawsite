In&nbsp;fact, Scandinavian warriors rarely wore helmets. Normally, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>were walking</a> around with bare heads, and if&nbsp;they wore helmets, they were simple (leather or&nbsp;metal), with face protection. Still, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> horns separately&nbsp;— they used to&nbsp;drink from them during feasts and they used to&nbsp;blow into them, which was a&nbsp;way of&nbsp;<a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a>.</p><p><h2>Myth #2: They were unkempt and didn’t take care of&nbsp;themselves.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc4/b79/2e7dbf53eeae89267a00904009.jpg><p>Archaeologists <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>discovered</a> various Viking hygiene items like tweezers, combs, ear cleaners, toothpicks, and so&nbsp;on. The English chronicler, John of&nbsp;Wallingford, described them as&nbsp;well-groomed heartbreakers. John writes that these tough men would comb their hair every day, wash every Saturday, and change their outfits frequently. The Viking beard could be&nbsp;worn at&nbsp;any length, but it&nbsp;was always neat.</p><p>They also liked bright clothes with decorations. Blue and red were the most popular ones though archeologists say that Vikings’ clothes could come in&nbsp;any color. Also, they appreciated exclusive fabrics like silk.</p><p><h2>Myth #3: They wore braids.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d7/b35/46cf5a5d7ca8645970dc1f7981.jpg><p>Men would <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wear</a> long bangs and have short hair on&nbsp;the back of&nbsp;their heads. They were actually following the fashion for hairstyles. For example, because blond guys were considered extremely attractive in&nbsp;Northern Europe, dark-haired Vikings would <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>bleach</a> their hair and even beards (in&nbsp;some regions) with lye.</p><p><h2>Myth #4: Men were tall and masculine.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/faf/38f/fe589b50bda7260bc319646868.jpg><p>Nutrition during those times wasn’t very good, which is&nbsp;why kids would grow <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>slower</a> than nowadays and people, in&nbsp;general, were not tall. The average height of&nbsp;a&nbsp;man was 5’6″, while women were on&nbsp;average 5’2″ tall. At&nbsp;the same time, physical labor made people’s bodies masculine. However, heavy loads would cause problems with joints and teeth.</p><p>The faces of&nbsp;men and women were very similar. Male faces were a&nbsp;little feminine, and female faces were a&nbsp;bit masculine, with pronounced jaws and brow ridges. That’s the reason why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;sometimes difficult for archaeologists to&nbsp;determine the <a href=# title=gender data-link=tag>gender</a> of&nbsp;the Vikings from their remains.</p><p>Also, just like women, men would use a&nbsp;special <a href=# title=eyeliner data-link=tag>eyeliner</a> called <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kohl</a>. It&nbsp;looked like powder made from crushed antimony, burnt almonds, lead, oxidized copper, ochre, ash, malachite, and chrysocolla. Not only was it&nbsp;considered beautiful but also helped protect eyes from the sharp sun rays reflected by&nbsp;the snow.</p><p><h2>Myth #5: Any medieval Scandinavian was a&nbsp;Viking.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b55/729/14b52651069b85660ea7d401e2.jpg><p>Norwegian people had 2&nbsp;words&nbsp;— viking (a&nbsp;raid) and vikingr (a&nbsp;raider). The Anglo-Saxons had a&nbsp;similar word&nbsp;— wicing. Initially, it&nbsp;meant “a&nbsp;pirate” but over time it&nbsp;turned into a&nbsp;name to&nbsp;call Norse marauders. This means that not all Scandinavians <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>were</a> Vikings.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, it&nbsp;was young people striving to&nbsp;go&nbsp;in&nbsp;search of&nbsp;wealth and adventures who became Vikings. That’s why Vikings <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t have</a> a&nbsp;centralized state and they were there not just in&nbsp;Scandinavia. Archeologists continue finding their traces all over the world.</p><p><h2>Myth #6: They would sail on&nbsp;ships with dragon heads.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7b1/71e/1c74155291ad911a43fc2f32f9.jpg><p>The only <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>evidence</a> of&nbsp;this is&nbsp;Scandinavian graffiti on&nbsp;the walls of&nbsp;Hagia Sophia in&nbsp;Istanbul, which depicts a&nbsp;small fleet of&nbsp;ships with dragon heads. The archaeological evidence is&nbsp;ambiguous.</p><p>The only ship presumably decorated with a&nbsp;dragon head was found in&nbsp;Denmark. It&nbsp;didn’t preserve entirely but the “dragon’s mane,” made of&nbsp;iron curls, survived. There was also a&nbsp;space where the head could fit.</p><p><h2>Myth #7: They were the only residents in&nbsp;medieval Scandinavia.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/090/211/58671255d588210b3eb096e3a7.jpg><p>Scandinavia was also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>inhabited</a> by&nbsp;the Sámi&nbsp;— semi-nomadic peoples who lived in&nbsp;the Far North, in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Norway data-link=tag>Norway</a>, <a href=# title=Sweden data-link=tag>Sweden</a>, <a href=# title=Finland data-link=tag>Finland</a>, and some parts of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Russia data-link=tag>Russia</a>. The Norwegians called these people Finnars. The 2&nbsp;groups would actively trade with each other and would participate in&nbsp;high-status marriages.</p><p><h2>Myth #8: They were just raiders and robbers.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/819/ef4/5ff6795fd9a9e8d19e1496fc34.jpg><p>Christopher Columbus (to&nbsp;the left) and Leif Erikson (to&nbsp;the right)</p><p>The Vikings have indeed become <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>famous</a> for some brutal raids on&nbsp;other peoples. One of&nbsp;the most famous examples was when they raided the monks from the island of&nbsp;Lindisfarne in&nbsp;the north of&nbsp;England, destroyed their famous library, and took all of&nbsp;their treasures.</p><p>Still, most expeditions were related to&nbsp;trade. Moreover, Nordic warriors were travelers and explorers. Not only did they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>go</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;Europe but also to&nbsp;Russia, Central Asia, and some regions in&nbsp;Africa.</p><p>Also, archaeologists <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> traces of&nbsp;Scandinavians in&nbsp;North America. The sailor, Leif Erikson, could be&nbsp;the first European who came to&nbsp;the New World. This lets&nbsp;us assume that America had been discovered in&nbsp;the 11th century, long before Christopher Columbus.</p><p><h2>Myth #9: They never stayed in&nbsp;the same place.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b43/23f/024d3556ca9a56d3dbbde99b38.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the second half of&nbsp;the 20th century, well-preserved Viking houses, their clothes, jewelry, and so&nbsp;on&nbsp;were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>found</a> in&nbsp;the ground during archaeological excavations that were carried out for several years in&nbsp;the Coppergate area of&nbsp;the English city of&nbsp;York. Since that time, scientists have changed their idea about these people and started to&nbsp;consider them as&nbsp;domestic, family people.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you like how Vikings are depicted in&nbsp;movies?
