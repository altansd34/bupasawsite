But what we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;<a href=# title="social media" data-link=tag>social media</a> are photos showing perfect bodies, a&nbsp;luminous look, and lots of&nbsp;filters. Against all this seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;Ady Del Valle, the plus-size model who came to&nbsp;revolutionize the fashion world, and much more than that. Here we&nbsp;tell you their story.</p><p>They weigh 449&nbsp;lbs, and they are gay. Arcadio “Ady” Del Valle <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>infiltrated</a> the world of&nbsp;fashion and left no&nbsp;one indifferent. Could it&nbsp;be&nbsp;that something has really begun to&nbsp;change?</p><p>It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;2015 when Ady first started posting selfies on&nbsp;<a href=# title=Instagram data-link=tag>Instagram</a>; their intention by&nbsp;no&nbsp;means was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;model, although they loved the fashion world. Ady felt like they didn’t belong to&nbsp;that glamorous world. What they wanted was to&nbsp;meet people like them.</p><p>That was their first step into social media where, despite what people say, there only seems to&nbsp;be&nbsp;room for what’s considered “normal.” But for Ady, it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;passage that allowed them to&nbsp;make visible what until now had been neglected.</p><p>They were born in&nbsp;Boston in&nbsp;1987 and come from a&nbsp;Puerto Rican family. For many years, Ady was a&nbsp;spectator of&nbsp;fashion shows, interviews with models, and the reality shows. That was until 2016 when they were approached by&nbsp;an&nbsp;independent designer who wanted them to&nbsp;walk the runway at&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>New York Fashion Week</a><i>.</i></p><p>At&nbsp;first, Ady resisted a&nbsp;little, considering it&nbsp;inconceivable to&nbsp;be&nbsp;walking down a&nbsp;catwalk. But then they agreed, following the advice of&nbsp;friends and family. Within a&nbsp;month, they were parading in&nbsp;an&nbsp;old church in&nbsp;New York with other XXXL-sized models.</p><p>But it&nbsp;happens that Ady is&nbsp;not just “a&nbsp;pretty face.” Their goal goes beyond a&nbsp;desire for personal fulfillment, which is&nbsp;something much deeper and collective. Ady’s figure and the photos in&nbsp;their networks push&nbsp;us to&nbsp;reflect.</p><p>Their career has undoubtedly created a&nbsp;revolution in&nbsp;the modeling industry, of&nbsp;which they are now a&nbsp;part. Their photos mark a&nbsp;before and after in&nbsp;social networks. Why has Ady become a&nbsp;disruptive reference in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;plus-size fashion?</p><p>Ady is&nbsp;shown on&nbsp;the beach, in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;a&nbsp;pool, or&nbsp;sunbathing with a&nbsp;bare torso or&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;full swimsuit. They mix tulle with animal print, lace bodices with digging thongs, and are light years away from the stereotype of&nbsp;the sullen man who wears a&nbsp;lumberjack shirt and does power work. For this plus-size model, clothing fulfills a&nbsp;function that until now excluded obese people: it&nbsp;no&nbsp;longer serves to&nbsp;cover&nbsp;up, on&nbsp;the contrary, it&nbsp;highlights the figure.</p><p>Today, Ady is&nbsp;an&nbsp;activist in&nbsp;the plus-size industry and aspires to&nbsp;stop people like them from being seen as&nbsp;an&nbsp;anomaly. They do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very clever way: instead of&nbsp;getting caught up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the networks, Ady uses them for his own purposes.</p><p>In&nbsp;their own words, “On&nbsp;Instagram, you’re going to&nbsp;see very few photos of&nbsp;plus-size men in&nbsp;swimsuits because they get taken down. Different bodies get deleted. And ultimately, they’re censoring someone who looks different because they’re bigger, or&nbsp;because they’re of&nbsp;color, or&nbsp;whatever. But we&nbsp;have more power than social media; without&nbsp;us, social media doesn’t exist.”</p><p>When asked why they think an&nbsp;XXXL body is&nbsp;annoying and not an&nbsp;XS one, Ady replies, “Since we&nbsp;are kids, we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;TV what beauty&nbsp;is, and we&nbsp;idolize it&nbsp;when we&nbsp;grow up&nbsp;because that’s what&nbsp;TV and magazines teach&nbsp;us. But these days there’s something different: with social media, people like me&nbsp;have an&nbsp;advantage. We&nbsp;can change that narrative so&nbsp;that others can see other bodies, and maybe one day&nbsp;TV and magazines will show these bodies, bodies like mine.”</p><p>Maybe yes, this time, we&nbsp;can get our hopes up&nbsp;and believe that something has finally started to&nbsp;change.</p><p>We&nbsp;all, to&nbsp;some extent, have an&nbsp;idea of&nbsp;what is&nbsp;considered to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>beautiful</a> and desirable. To&nbsp;deny this would be&nbsp;untrue. Going against <a href=#>a&nbsp;stereotype</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot like swimming against the current. However, there are more and more <a href=#>brave people</a> who manage to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it, and they have earned our respect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uvMuuqmarma%2Bybr3UnpyrZZ2ksaa4jKmmrJ2jYravecBmpqedXaW2pq%2FEZpinnF2kvLux0maZqJypYr2wv8itoK%2BhpK56eX2TcHBvZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
