GCU&nbsp;focus on 3 key areas, namely: Inclusive Societies; Healthy Lives; and Sustainable Environments. This results in a wide range of educational specialisms –&nbsp;from Optometry, to Big Data, Luxury Brand Management to Climate Justice and Social Business and Microfinance – each combining applied research and educational excellence to provide their&nbsp;students with career focused content, to enable them to have an impact, to tackle some of the many global challenges of our time.</p><h3>Global Community</h3><p>Glasgow Caledonian University leads the way not only in what they&nbsp;teach but also how they teach; they&nbsp;are committed to providing all students, irrespective of their backgrounds, an opportunity to access higher education and research. As part of the University’s mission to promote the common good, they&nbsp;work with schools, children and families across their&nbsp;global community to raise educational aspirations in young people and their families. They&nbsp;also harness the knowledge and experience of industry through guest lectures, masterclasses and live student projects, to ensure your student experience is innovative, challenging and aligned to industry needs.</p><h3>World-class Facilities</h3><p>With a new campus, in the heart of Glasgow city Centre – one of the friendliest cities in the world – GCU&nbsp;are proud to offer students a host of world-class facilities, from their&nbsp;inter-professional simulation centre, Eye Clinic and Physio Clinic, to their&nbsp;Cyber Security Clinic and green rooms –&nbsp; not to mention their&nbsp;mock court, Law Clinic and broadcasting facilities. Their&nbsp;students also have access to almost 100 different student societies covering a wide range of activities, hobbies and sports and are proud to be winners of the 2019 Student Engagement Awards for recognising cultural diversity and embedding intercultural skills in the curriculum – being a student here really is a great experience.</p><h3>Student Experience</h3><p>The University is committed to providing all students, irrespective of their backgrounds, an opportunity to access higher education and research. It delivers high-quality education, with a focus on the provision of care and support to students, and places student engagement and participation at the heart of their learning community.</p><p>Glasgow Caledonian University is committed to promoting equality and diversity. Its commitment to gender equality was recognised by it attaining Advance HE’s Athena Swan Institutional Silver Award, and the University has signed up to Advance HE’s Race Equality Charter Bronze Award.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Employability</h3><p>Glasgow Caledonian University harnesses the knowledge and experience of industry through guest lectures, masterclasses and live student projects, to ensure graduate employability is central to the learning experience. Work placements enable students to gain really valuable opportunities. Graduate Apprenticeships and other work-based learning deepens connections with employers, benefiting all students. This focus on employability means that students are prepared for the workplace and equipped to succeed in their chosen careers.</p><h3>Community</h3><p>Glasgow Caledonian’s College Connect Team delivers a dedicated service to help students transition from college to university. The University’s Caledonian Club, an award-winning outreach initiative, has helped 20,000 local children, families and carers, many from disadvantaged backgrounds, and its&nbsp; Advanced Higher Hub gives important opportunities to senior school pupils across Glasgow to access higher and further education.&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent independent report by BiGGAR Economics concluded that it is a valuable asset to the city, not only bringing economic and employment opportunities, but working to address the deep-rooted economic, social and health inequalities in the city.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjqyrrpypZMCku9OtoKygXaq7qsLEq6qirJmawHCzy5qqoKenYrCiuMSdpqehkaN6trrIr5yrq5mpxg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
