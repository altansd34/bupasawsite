The woman’s sister has been an&nbsp;embodiment of&nbsp;evil throughout her life, and she brought a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;suffering to&nbsp;our heroine. But karma fired back at&nbsp;the vile woman during one of&nbsp;their <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> gatherings, and now our heroine can say that revenge is&nbsp;the dish that is&nbsp;best served when cold.</p><p><h2>The relationships between sisters have always been nasty.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/215/dde/a92ca250df83912826763cc697.jpg><p>An&nbsp;anonymous woman, 38, has written a&nbsp;letter to&nbsp;our editorial and told&nbsp;us the story from her life, that made&nbsp;us strongly believe in&nbsp;karma.</p><p>The woman started her letter by&nbsp;saying, «My&nbsp;parents have 3&nbsp;daughters. Maya, me&nbsp;and Sally. Sally has always been the problem. When she was born she had a&nbsp;severe medical condition which led doctors to&nbsp;believe that Sally wouldn’t survive at&nbsp;all. But my&nbsp;parents never gave up&nbsp;on&nbsp;Sally. They spent enormous amounts of&nbsp;money and time on&nbsp;her treatment and one day miracle happened. Since then they have <a href=# title=loved data-link=tag>loved</a> Sally more than anything and she became the favorite in&nbsp;the family. She always had only the best things. I&nbsp;mostly got my&nbsp;sister’s small clothes and hand-me-downs.»</p><p>The woman explained, " I&nbsp;didn’t mind it&nbsp;but it&nbsp;was unfair that&nbsp;I was the forever neglected child. I&nbsp;was the scapegoat. For some weird reasons, Sally was always in&nbsp;competition with me&nbsp;and my&nbsp;parents also pitted&nbsp;us against each other. I&nbsp;was always supposed to&nbsp;behave and never complain. And my&nbsp;sister Sally was a&nbsp;brat. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;dollhouse, Sally had a&nbsp;bigger one. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;did something good my&nbsp;parents would just say «well done» and forget about&nbsp;it. But if&nbsp;Sally even won any competition they would throw a&nbsp;party. Since then I’ve walking on&nbsp;eggshells around my&nbsp;parents. I&nbsp;had always been grounded and&nbsp;I didn’t even complain Sally has been teasing me&nbsp;and our other sister Maya, all because she was a&nbsp;«special child»."</p><p><h2>With time, everything got even worse.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/447/286/3b025053edbed8f757c029069f.jpg><p>Our heroine goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «Sally has always been awful towards&nbsp;me. She would often tease and torment me&nbsp;and even steal my&nbsp;stuff. My&nbsp;parents didn’t do&nbsp;anything. And like&nbsp;I mentioned Sally was always in&nbsp;competition with&nbsp;me. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;ever wanted to&nbsp;participate in&nbsp;a&nbsp;music contest, she would too. I&nbsp;remember having a&nbsp;crush in&nbsp;high school. What did Sally do? She made out with that crush in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;parents didn’t even have enough money for college for Maya and&nbsp;me, but Maya got a&nbsp;scholarship and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;loan.»</p><p>The last straw was when Sally interfered with a&nbsp;big love of&nbsp;our heroine. She wrote, " I&nbsp;was dating a&nbsp;guy in&nbsp;college and&nbsp;I loved him so&nbsp;much. Sally brought him home when his parents were away. I&nbsp;caught them kissing passionately in&nbsp;our basement. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;huge pain for&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;parents berated Sally a&nbsp;little bit, but after a&nbsp;few days, they were like «Well, what happened just happened. We&nbsp;cannot separate these love birds.»</p><p>That was it&nbsp;for our heroine. She screamed at&nbsp;her parents that she had endured their neglect for all these years but wasn’t going to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;anymore. The woman cut off contact with her family and there was a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;tension for several years.</p><p><h2>Things were getting better for the woman and she became happy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/56f/de1/8a872b5564b08fc0416e5c77dc.jpg><p>The woman wrote, «Sally remained just as&nbsp;shameless as&nbsp;she has always been and started dating my&nbsp;ex. I&nbsp;eventually got over it&nbsp;and soon&nbsp;I met a&nbsp;very nice guy and we&nbsp;got married. I&nbsp;invited our parents to&nbsp;the wedding but not Sally. My&nbsp;parents declined my&nbsp;invitation and showed me&nbsp;their disrespect again, but&nbsp;I didn’t mind, as&nbsp;I was happy.»</p><p>The woman shared that she is&nbsp;currently pregnant with her first child. Her parents did reach out to&nbsp;her once and despite being skeptical, she finally agreed to&nbsp;reconcile.</p><p>The woman went on&nbsp;with her story, saying, «Our family has a&nbsp;tradition when they arrange a&nbsp;big dinner once a&nbsp;year at&nbsp;my&nbsp;parents’ place. All our relatives and cousins are usually invited to&nbsp;it. After I&nbsp;reconciled with my&nbsp;parents, I&nbsp;came to&nbsp;that dinner with my&nbsp;husband, Adam. Sister Sally was also there with her husband, it&nbsp;was my&nbsp;ex, whom she stole from me&nbsp;many years ago. During the evening, to&nbsp;everyone’s shock, Sally tried to&nbsp;be&nbsp;closer to&nbsp;my&nbsp;husband. He&nbsp;would just ignore her. When it&nbsp;was time for dinner, my&nbsp;parents made a&nbsp;speech. Then Sally suddenly stood up&nbsp;and declared that she was so&nbsp;lucky to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there with&nbsp;us and that she could have died when she was a&nbsp;baby.»</p><p><h2>Sally wanted to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;superstar at&nbsp;the family dinner, and she got what she deserved.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d36/ce5/e429d35ad3a18ab5f5d5c58679.jpg><p>The woman wrote, «Sally turned to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and and said «Dear sister, I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;painful for you because your beloved is&nbsp;now my&nbsp;husband but I’m grateful for your blessing. I&nbsp;know it&nbsp;must be&nbsp;so&nbsp;unbearable for you to&nbsp;be&nbsp;here knowing how difficult it&nbsp;was for you to&nbsp;compete with me&nbsp;but&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;applaud your bravery.»</p><p>At&nbsp;that very moment Adam, our heroine’s husband, stood up&nbsp;and shouted at&nbsp;Sally. The woman wrote, «He&nbsp;was saying how dare she insult&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;said, «You think you are very special because you were a&nbsp;miracle baby. Well, I&nbsp;was a&nbsp;miracle baby too but&nbsp;I don’t make a&nbsp;fuss about it&nbsp;like you&nbsp;do. You are such a&nbsp;pathetic lady that the only achievement in&nbsp;your life you have is&nbsp;your accidental survival. What else have you accomplished? Everything you have was stolen from my&nbsp;wife, even your husband. You are so&nbsp;irritating that even your husband doesn’t like you. Do&nbsp;you know what the truth&nbsp;is? You have nothing and you are nothing. You are very shameless and you even tried to&nbsp;hit on&nbsp;me. You already got my&nbsp;wife’s ex&nbsp;and now you want her husband. I&nbsp;would rather die than be&nbsp;with a&nbsp;woman like you, your personality is&nbsp;worth a&nbsp;paper bag.»</p><p>Adam also mentioned that Sally has always been jealous of&nbsp;our heroine because she knew she would never be&nbsp;as&nbsp;amazing as&nbsp;she&nbsp;is.</p><p>The woman wrote, «There was more but it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;brutal that Sally burst into tears. My&nbsp;parents and all my&nbsp;relatives were shocked. Even my&nbsp;cousins were silent. I&nbsp;knew that everyone in&nbsp;the room hated Sally. I&nbsp;was just laughing silently. My&nbsp;mom noticed and said&nbsp;I was a&nbsp;vicious person for laughing at&nbsp;my&nbsp;sister’s misery. But I&nbsp;don’t mind, it’s karma.»</p><p>And here’s yet another story, from a&nbsp;woman, who was sick and tired of&nbsp;her neighbors complaining about her clothes, and she plotted a&nbsp;<a href=#>petty revenge</a> that left the nosy neighbors in&nbsp;shock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKiqq2domK1or%2BMm5yepl2pvLO5xKeroqaXYrqmecClo2alqWK5qrLEZquonJGuerS0xGapnpuVnsOmsIyapWadoJ6wbrzAspmam5tihXKElGlvaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
