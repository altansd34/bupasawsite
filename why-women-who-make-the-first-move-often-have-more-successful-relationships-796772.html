However, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>research</a> conducted by&nbsp;the popular <a href=# title=dating data-link=tag>dating</a> website OkCupid, it’s time for women to&nbsp;come out of&nbsp;their shells and take things into their own very capable hands.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> looked deeper into the study’s findings and are rushing to&nbsp;you with valid reasons why ladies should step up&nbsp;to&nbsp;the dating frontlines.</p><p><h2>Women don’t need to&nbsp;waste time waiting for an&nbsp;eligible guy to&nbsp;appear.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/201/330/16b10a535fa351666ba39cee44.jpg><p>By&nbsp;the dating website standard, men send way more messages than women and that is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fact. This strategy has the same principle as&nbsp;fishing, the bigger net you cast, the higher your chances are of&nbsp;catching something or&nbsp;someone (this might be&nbsp;where the old “there’s plenty of&nbsp;fish on&nbsp;the sea” saying comes from).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c26/5e4/433b625972bf7b03e0b144add1.jpg><p>But we&nbsp;know that quantity has nothing on&nbsp;quality, and women can spend days if&nbsp;not months on&nbsp;a&nbsp;dating website waiting for their prince charming to&nbsp;gallop into their DMs. And being overwhelmed by&nbsp;choices might even lower their chance of&nbsp;locating that special someone. This truly might be&nbsp;the time to&nbsp;stop sitting around and finally take matters into your own hands.</p><p><h2>Women who approach men first immediately spark their interest.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/159/156/e61cdc5d6f82e6e0b5b3785cfa.jpg><p>Interestingly, no&nbsp;matter how many messages women receive, their response rate stays pretty much the same. However, it’s the complete opposite with men. The more messages they receive, the more they send, and ladies should use this information to&nbsp;their own advantage. The study says that women are 2.5 times more likely to&nbsp;hear from a&nbsp;guy if&nbsp;they make the first move. We&nbsp;like how those odds sound!</p><p>In&nbsp;addition, women have the advantage of&nbsp;starting a&nbsp;conversation any way they want. No&nbsp;more cheesy pick-up lines is&nbsp;starting to&nbsp;sound pretty good, right?</p><p><h2>Women can get themselves a&nbsp;better match if&nbsp;they take the initiative.</h2></p><p>Now this is&nbsp;where things get interesting. OkCupid determined that people usually reach out to&nbsp;someone hotter than they are. Men, in&nbsp;particular, tend to&nbsp;message women who are on&nbsp;average&nbsp;17% more attractive than they are. So&nbsp;by&nbsp;taking the initiative, ladies can make sure they’ll talk to&nbsp;good-looking guys, and it&nbsp;doesn’t have to&nbsp;end at&nbsp;looks. It’s also about the overall appeal of&nbsp;a&nbsp;mate, including their social status and interests. Overall, it’s a&nbsp;win-win for females.</p><p><h2>Women have a&nbsp;better chance of&nbsp;finding love if&nbsp;they act first.</h2></p><p>For most people on&nbsp;dating websites, the endgame is&nbsp;starting a&nbsp;relationship and finding their soulmate. And, yes, if&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman makes the first move, the probability of&nbsp;that happening goes&nbsp;up. Another online dating platform The League also conducted their own <a href=#>survey</a>. They found out that 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;3&nbsp;couples on&nbsp;their app started with a&nbsp;female messaging first, and those relationships that resulted in&nbsp;engagement saw women have “3x&nbsp;the initiation rate of&nbsp;a&nbsp;typical female user.” Conclusion: being a&nbsp;go-getter pays off, even in&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a>.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think about women making a&nbsp;first move when dating?
