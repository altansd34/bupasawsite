I’ve been stretching my&nbsp;muscles for 10&nbsp;minutes a&nbsp;day for a&nbsp;month and now&nbsp;I can see some unexpected changes in&nbsp;my&nbsp;body.</p><p>Especially for <strong>Bright Side</strong>, I’d like to&nbsp;share the results&nbsp;I experienced after this experiment and&nbsp;I really hope to&nbsp;encourage our readers to&nbsp;follow my&nbsp;example.</p><p><h2>My&nbsp;stretching routine:</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/712/155/dabb6751a6b71d9b8a67ae0021.jpg><ul><li><strong>Head-to-knee bend</strong>: Sit down on&nbsp;the floor with your right leg extended to&nbsp;the side, your left knee bent, and the sole of&nbsp;your left foot near your inner right thigh. Bend to&nbsp;your right side and grab your right foot with both hands. Hold for 60&nbsp;seconds, then switch sides.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0d/084/956ddb55c4b959d0befb73ce3f.jpg><ul><li><strong>Frog pose</strong>: Sit down on&nbsp;the floor with your feet below your buttocks and your knees wide apart. Keeping your feet on&nbsp;the ground, raise your buttocks and walk your hands forward along the floor as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;possible. Allow your legs to&nbsp;separate until you feel a&nbsp;stretch in&nbsp;your thighs. Hold the pose for 2&nbsp;minutes.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cc2/95b/d7669651a78e6776953321233e.jpg><ul><li><strong>Cobra pose</strong>: Lie down on&nbsp;your stomach.

I&nbsp;started sleeping better.</h2></p><p>Back pain wasn’t my&nbsp;only problem before the experiment. I&nbsp;also had some pretty annoying <a href=#>sleeping issues</a>. Insomnia, troubled sleep, feeling exhausted right after waking up&nbsp;— these words were well-known to&nbsp;me. But I&nbsp;didn’t really expect that <strong>stretching could help me&nbsp;get a&nbsp;good night’s rest</strong>.</p><p>It&nbsp;turns out that <strong>stretching before bed can relieve muscle tension</strong> and prevent sleep-disrupting cramps. When there’s nothing to&nbsp;disturb you at&nbsp;night, the quality of&nbsp;your sleep is&nbsp;improved and you feel more refreshed in&nbsp;the morning. So&nbsp;no&nbsp;more chamomile tea for&nbsp;me, stretching is&nbsp;the best remedy!</p><p><h2>7. I&nbsp;finally feel my&nbsp;own body.</h2></p><p>Of&nbsp;course, stretching is&nbsp;the perfect way to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;<a href=#>great body</a>. But that’s not the point here. For&nbsp;me, <strong>stretching exercises have become a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;get my&nbsp;body back</strong>.</p><p>When you sit at&nbsp;your desk all day long, you literally don’t feel your legs on&nbsp;your way home from work. That’s how it&nbsp;was for&nbsp;me. But when&nbsp;I started stretching, I&nbsp;realized that <strong>my&nbsp;body needed my&nbsp;attention more than&nbsp;I actually thought.</strong> This better body awareness that developed as&nbsp;a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the stretching allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue stretching in&nbsp;a&nbsp;smarter way, working on&nbsp;those muscles that were weaker and needed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;toned&nbsp;up.</p><p><h2>6. I&nbsp;feel less sluggish.</h2></p><p>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;have <strong>trouble staying awake during my&nbsp;long, dragging day of&nbsp;work</strong>. Around midafternoon, I&nbsp;felt so&nbsp;sluggish and lethargic that all&nbsp;I could do&nbsp;is&nbsp;try to&nbsp;think of&nbsp;a&nbsp;place where&nbsp;I could take a&nbsp;nap safely, while my&nbsp;boss was busy with other things.</p><p><a href=#>Stretching</a> right at&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk for 10&nbsp;minutes a&nbsp;day helped me&nbsp;<strong>significantly increase my&nbsp;<a href=# title=energy data-link=tag>energy</a> level</strong>. I&nbsp;don’t feel lazy anymore. On&nbsp;the contrary, my&nbsp;productivity at&nbsp;work improved and I’ve even adopted the habit of&nbsp;taking a&nbsp;walk during my&nbsp;lunch break. Goodbye to&nbsp;my&nbsp;midday fatigue!</p><p><h2>5. My&nbsp;back pain has gone away.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ae3/5fc/a773e654a593ae00c821367055.jpg><p>The constant pain in&nbsp;my&nbsp;back is&nbsp;what made me&nbsp;start this experiment. I&nbsp;had always heard that stretching helps heal and prevent <a href=#>lower back pain</a> by&nbsp;<strong>strengthening the muscles and reducing the risk for muscle strain</strong>. Surprisingly, it&nbsp;was true.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;repetitive sitter, who practically has no&nbsp;time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;a&nbsp;full workout every day, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;choose something that could <strong>reduce the stiffness in&nbsp;my&nbsp;back </strong>and return mobility to&nbsp;my&nbsp;glute muscles without being too time-consuming. Turned out, stretching was a&nbsp;great choice.</p><p>After a&nbsp;month of&nbsp;doing stretching exercises, I&nbsp;finally feel relieved&nbsp;— and there’s no&nbsp;pain anymore. Besides that, <strong>my&nbsp;muscles have become stronger</strong> and there are no&nbsp;more knots in&nbsp;my&nbsp;shoulders.</p><p><h2>4. My&nbsp;lab results have become better.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99b/403/382f6f5a7eb01a7c57b2761a40.jpg><p>Some studies show that stretching exercises also help lower <a href=#>cholesterol</a> and keep <a href=#>glucose levels</a> in&nbsp;check by&nbsp;<strong>preventing the hardening of&nbsp;arteries</strong> and increasing blood flow to&nbsp;all your internal organs. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;prove this point too.</p><p>Before the experiment, I&nbsp;didn’t really care about my&nbsp;health. A&nbsp;lack of&nbsp;regular exercise, poor dietary habits, and sedentary lifestyle&nbsp;— all contributed to&nbsp;my&nbsp;high <a href=# title=cholesterol data-link=tag>cholesterol</a> and sugar levels. However, <strong>stretching on&nbsp;a&nbsp;routine basis helped me&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot</strong>&nbsp;— the results of&nbsp;my&nbsp;blood tests went back to&nbsp;normal.</p><p><h2>3. My&nbsp;coordination has improved.</h2></p><p>“<a href=#>Stretching</a> can prevent muscle tightness and <strong>bring your body back to&nbsp;feeling more balanced</strong>,” that’s what&nbsp;I read a&nbsp;month ago. Well, I&nbsp;can’t say that&nbsp;I had some coordination issues in&nbsp;the past&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you sit still in&nbsp;your chair throughout a&nbsp;day, you don’t need to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;perfect sense of&nbsp;balance, right?</p><p>However, I&nbsp;felt that something was wrong when&nbsp;I tried to&nbsp;ride a&nbsp;bike a&nbsp;few years ago. I&nbsp;just couldn’t keep it&nbsp;balanced, and it&nbsp;would start to&nbsp;lean here and there over and over again. Today, I&nbsp;just can’t understand why such an&nbsp;easy task was so&nbsp;difficult for me&nbsp;and I’m proud to&nbsp;say that&nbsp;<strong>I finally showed gravity who’s boss</strong>!</p><p><h2>2. I&nbsp;feel less stressed.</h2></p><p><strong>When you’re experiencing stress, there’s a&nbsp;good chance that your muscles are tense</strong>. This is&nbsp;called <a href=#>psychosomatics</a>. In&nbsp;theory, this sounds pretty sensible, but&nbsp;I would have never thought that stretching really works better than any sedatives.</p><p>I’ve already mentioned that my&nbsp;productivity at&nbsp;work has improved. But it&nbsp;didn’t just happen because of&nbsp;the energy boost. <strong>Stretching has also helped me&nbsp;calm my&nbsp;mind and return my&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;well-being</strong>. This mental calm has actually helped me&nbsp;feel relaxed and work with a&nbsp;clear mind, without any annoying or&nbsp;negative thoughts.</p><p><h2>1. I&nbsp;don’t feel cold all the time.</h2></p><p>You probably know that <strong>stretching increases the blood supply to&nbsp;your muscle tissue</strong>. However, I&nbsp;personally had no&nbsp;idea that this benefit would concern not only my&nbsp;muscles, but all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;internal organs and body parts too.</p><p>Without moving too much, <strong>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;always feel cold</strong>, especially in&nbsp;my&nbsp;hands and feet. Whatever I&nbsp;did to&nbsp;warm them up&nbsp;didn’t work in&nbsp;the long run&nbsp;— my&nbsp;palms were freezing again after a&nbsp;few minutes of&nbsp;exercising.</p><p>A&nbsp;stretching routine has allowed me&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>enhance the transportation of&nbsp;oxygen and nutrient-rich blood throughout the whole body</strong>. Now, this better <a href=#>circulation</a> helps me&nbsp;keeps my&nbsp;temperature normal in&nbsp;all of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body parts naturally.</p><p>How often do&nbsp;you stretch your muscles?
