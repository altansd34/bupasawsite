Megan competed on Kelly Clarkson’s team in season 18, and now she’s reaching for another chance at stardom.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-s-megan-danielle-was-on-the-voice>American Idol‘s Megan Danielle Was on The Voice</h2><p>Megan auditioned for Season 18 of The Voice with a rendition of “Remedy” by Adele that turned coach Kelly Clarkson’s chair. The young singer made it all the way to the Semifinals before she was eliminated, after singing such songs as “Top of the World” by The Chicks and “Anyone” by Demi Lovato.</p><p>Megan’s parents divorced when she was 7 years old, and she and her three siblings were raised by a single mother. During her time on The Voice, Megan touched on her emotions about her father leaving in a performance of Clarkson’s song “Piece By Piece” during the Knockouts.</p><p>The 20-year-old singer is from Douglasville, Georgia. As a teenager, Megan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>played on her school’s softball team</a> and worked as a waitress in her mom’s restaurant. She shared in her Idol audition that her late grandfather was the one who encouraged her to pursue Christian music.</p><p>Since her time on The Voice, Megan has released a studio version of her “Top of the World” cover. Then in 2021, she released an original Christian song called “All Around.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">‘AMERICAN IDOL’S NOAH THOMPSON, HUNTERGIRL RELEASE FIRST SONG TOGETHER</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10caahWCUNQ</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-megan-met-lauren-daigle-during-her-audition>Megan Met Lauren Daigle During Her Audition</h2><p>For her audition, Megan performed “You Say” by Lauren Daigle. The show surprised the singer by having Daigle herself walk into the audition room to sing along with her as she performed. The two of them finished the song together.</p><p>Megan earned three “yes” votes from the judges to get a Golden Ticket to Hollywood Week. She made it through that round before being pitted against fellow contestant Paige Anne in a sing-off during the Showstoppers round. Megan earned a spot in the Top 26, although Paige was later invited back to the show.</p><p>To celebrate being voted into the Top 12, Megan once again paid tribute to Lauren Daigle by performing her song “Thank God I Do.” If you want to hear more from Megan while you wait for her next performance, you can follow her on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Original_JackieFabulous_Noam-GalaiNBC-220x147.jpeg alt="‘AGT’ Comedian Jackie Fabulous Performs on ‘The Tonight Show’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWdmrSiuoydmKehlaG5pnnFqKmmnaJiwamxjK%2BmopuVYsC1rdFmmqiloJrBqrrGZqanZZGisrO1wpqlZqGUpLlw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
