In&amp;nbsp;some cases, like with peacocks, the colorful “eyes” on&amp;nbsp;their tails help them with their romantic endeavors.

太古の昔より大自然の恵みを享受してきたウェールズの大地。北・西・南側の3方を海に囲まれ、東の南北はイングランドとの国境が縦に走ります。全土が1400キロメートルに及ぶ遊歩道（内1200キロメートルが海岸遊歩道）で繋がり、延々と伸びる砂浜と断崖絶壁、森林や渓谷、野花の絨毯の丘や遺跡や古城、息を飲むような景観に溢れ、多くの野生動物・野鳥が生息しております。
温暖な気候に恵まれ、農牧業が盛ん。石炭・スレート・ウェルシュゴールドなど希少性の高い鉱物資源が産業革命の時代を支えました。
「ウェールズ」という呼称は、ウェールズを侵攻したアングロ・サクソンの人々がつけた呼び名で、「異邦人」という古語に由来。これに対し、ウェールズ人は、自身をウェールズ語で「カムリ/Cymru（同胞・仲間）」と呼んでいます。美しい風景に恵まれているという価値だけでなく、何世代にもわたり生活を営んできた、愛国心溢れる民族の深い歴史と文化、言葉、音楽、芸術の伝統がこの国の真価であり、ウェールズの国そのものがケルトから引き継がれている「文化遺産」です。ヨーロッパ最古の言語と１つと言われているウェールズ語の文化・教育は今も政府により大切に引き継がれ、ウエールズの小学校から全員がウェールズ語の授業を受け、２つの公用語を習得しております。
ウェールズの歴史概要：

As&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;spend our time scrolling, searching, and surfing, we&amp;nbsp;experience fewer offline interactions. Thus, 7.86 million people are using online dating apps, hoping to&amp;nbsp;find love. But is&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;actually possible to&amp;nbsp;find true love online? As&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;turns out, it&amp;nbsp;is.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side found out which of&amp;nbsp;our favorite celebrities managed to&amp;nbsp;find love online and want to&amp;nbsp;share the findings with our readers.

If you’re not a natural-born speller, English pronunciation and spelling rules can be a real challenge and grounds for a massive headache.
Just when you think you’ve gotten the hang of how one sound is spelled, a rhyming word pops up with an entirely different spelling—take “meat” and “greet” for example—and your world comes crumbling down.</description></item><item><title>10 pdcast para aprender ingls que necesitas en tu vida</title><link>/podcasts-para-aprender-ingles.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/podcasts-para-aprender-ingles.html</guid><description>¿Por qué te recomendamos escuchar un pódcast para aprender inglés?

An&amp;nbsp;unexpected ingenious idea or&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;bright guess oftentimes gives&amp;nbsp;us a&amp;nbsp;feeling of&amp;nbsp;deep satisfaction&amp;nbsp;— all because it’s always nice to&amp;nbsp;find something similar to&amp;nbsp;Albert Einstein in&amp;nbsp;yourself.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side found 10&amp;nbsp;unexpected signs that reveal the hidden genius in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;person.
1. Frequent feeling of&amp;nbsp;boredom
Intelligent people always feel bored when they do&amp;nbsp;routine things. This is&amp;nbsp;connected with the fact that by&amp;nbsp;having a&amp;nbsp;lot of&amp;nbsp;knowledge and skills, people with a&amp;nbsp;more developed intellect can’t engage all their potential when performing mundane tasks.</description></item><item><title>11 Celebrities Copied Their Colleagues Outfits, and We Cant Decide Who Wins This Fashion Battl</title><link>/11-celebrities-copied-their-colleagues-outfits-and-we-cant-decide-who-wins-this-fashion-battle-797826.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/11-celebrities-copied-their-colleagues-outfits-and-we-cant-decide-who-wins-this-fashion-battle-797826.html</guid><description>Some world-famous celebrities hire a&amp;nbsp;whole team of&amp;nbsp;stylists and makeup artists to&amp;nbsp;make their every public appearance spectacular and original. But not everyone manages to&amp;nbsp;look unique when coming up&amp;nbsp;with a&amp;nbsp;new look, because different celebrities may like similar outfits from the same fashion brands and designers. And sometimes, celebrities mirror their colleagues on&amp;nbsp;purpose. While some of&amp;nbsp;them do&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;very delicately, only borrowing some details and distinctive features here and there, others completely copy other celebrities’ outfits.</description></item><item><title>14 World Records You Can Break Right Away Without Specialized Training</title><link>/14-world-records-you-can-break-right-away-without-specialized-training-801815.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/14-world-records-you-can-break-right-away-without-specialized-training-801815.html</guid><description>Some world records may be&amp;nbsp;impossible for&amp;nbsp;us to&amp;nbsp;break. After all, not all of&amp;nbsp;us can train like Usain Bolt and can run a&amp;nbsp;100-meter dash in&amp;nbsp;just 9.58&amp;nbsp;seconds. Not everything is&amp;nbsp;beyond our reach though, as&amp;nbsp;there are some achievements that we&amp;nbsp;might actually succeed in&amp;nbsp;beating, even if&amp;nbsp;we’re just in&amp;nbsp;the comfort of&amp;nbsp;our own homes.
Bright Side found these feats that we&amp;nbsp;can try to&amp;nbsp;beat, just for fun.

But it’s not so&amp;nbsp;easy to&amp;nbsp;see the real heroes who perform such incredible stunts: even official websites are reluctant to&amp;nbsp;talk about the film’s stuntmen.
But nothing can stop Bright Side. And today we&amp;nbsp;present the coolest and the nicest stuntmen from very popular movies.

However, some women in&amp;nbsp;Hollywood disagree with this claim, and they prove that we&amp;nbsp;become stronger by&amp;nbsp;supporting and praising each other.

They’re actually metal rails put along the sides and the back of&amp;nbsp;the bus to&amp;nbsp;protect its rather thin walls. In&amp;nbsp;case of&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;collision, they absorb most of&amp;nbsp;its force. It&amp;nbsp;means that the crash doesn’t affect large areas. These “rub rails” are also positioned in&amp;nbsp;strategically important spots. The lowest one runs at&amp;nbsp;the floor level. The middle matches the bottom of&amp;nbsp;the seats. And the top one corresponds either to&amp;nbsp;the top of&amp;nbsp;the seats or&amp;nbsp;the bottom of&amp;nbsp;the window.</description></item><item><title>The 20 Coolest Multimedia Acts In 'AGT' History</title><link>/the-10-coolest-multimedia-acts-in-agt-history.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-10-coolest-multimedia-acts-in-agt-history.html</guid><description>TALENTRECAP.COM Talent Got Talent

It might come as a surprise then that Germany has also produced so many extraordinary rock stars, with all the reckless swagger that title implies.

It’s normal for skin to&amp;nbsp;dry out and for the underlying layer of&amp;nbsp;fat to&amp;nbsp;shrink. Any face will lose its smooth surface and get wrinkles.
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side rounded up&amp;nbsp;close-ups of&amp;nbsp;celebrities from different decades to&amp;nbsp;check how their face has changed with age, and we&amp;nbsp;want to&amp;nbsp;share them with you.

From as&amp;nbsp;early as&amp;nbsp;the 10th-century, horse riders began wearing boots with heels because they allowed them to&amp;nbsp;have a&amp;nbsp;firmer grip in&amp;nbsp;the stirrups. Yet nowadays, all of&amp;nbsp;us, no&amp;nbsp;matter men or&amp;nbsp;women, suffer from blisters, calluses, uncomfortable shoes, heels, and bad footwear. Luckily, the situation has improved a&amp;nbsp;lot over the last 11&amp;nbsp;centuries.

Bright Side found 6&amp;nbsp;beautiful movies and series that saw past skin color and allowed traditionally white characters to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;played by&amp;nbsp;people of&amp;nbsp;color.
