Before you start to freak out, let’s clarify a few things. French tenses include the present, past, and future tenses. They indicate when an action occurs.<br>However, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French grammar</a> also uses moods,&nbsp;les modes,&nbsp;to indicate how the speaker feels about the action. For example, a speaker who wants to express a possibility would use the conditional while someone who wants to give a command would use the imperative. Each of these moods has different tenses, but some of them aren’t really used anymore. So, although there are over 20 different ways to conjugate a verb according to mood and tense, you don’t need to know all of them to get by.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=French-tenses-to-know>French tenses to know</h2><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Indicative</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Present</strong></h4><p>When to use it: You’ll use this tense quite often to talk about actions that are currently happening.<br>Example:&nbsp;J’apprends le français.&nbsp;(I’m learning French.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Compound past</strong></h4><p>When to use it: Also known as&nbsp;le passé composé, you’ll use this tense to talk about actions that have been completed in the past.<br>Example:&nbsp;J’ai mangé une pomme.&nbsp;(I ate an apple.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Imperfect</strong></h4><p>When to use it: This past tense is needed to talk about actions that are incomplete. Use it to describe continuous actions or states of being.<br>Example:&nbsp;Quand j’étais jeune, j’étais souvent timide.&nbsp;(When I was young, I was often shy.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Pluperfect</strong></h4><p>When to use it: If you’re talking about two related actions that happened in the past, conjugate the verb that happened first with the&nbsp;plus-que-parfait.<br>Example:&nbsp;Il était déjà parti quand je suis arrivée. (He had already left when I arrived.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Future</strong></h4><p>When to use it: If you want to talk about actions that will take place in the future, you can use this tense.<br>Example:&nbsp;J’irai au supermarché demain matin.&nbsp;(I’ll go to the supermarket tomorrow morning.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Anterior Future</strong></h4><p>When to use it: Also known as the future perfect, you can use this tense to talk about an action that will have been completed in the future<br>Example:&nbsp;Demain, j’aurai fini mon travail.&nbsp;(Tomorrow, I will have finished my work.)</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Conditional</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Present</strong></h4><p>When to use it: You’ll want to use the present conditional to talk about an action that may or may not take place.<br>Example:&nbsp;J’appellerais si j’avais mon téléphone portable. (I would call if I had my mobile phone.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Past</strong></h4><p>When to use it: Whenever you want to talk about an action that might have happened, but didn’t, use the conditional past.<br>Example:&nbsp;Si j’avais su, j’aurais aidé.&nbsp;(If I had known, I would’ve helped.)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Subjunctive</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Present</strong></h4><p>When to use it: The subjunctive is used when you express feelings of doubt or desire. It can also be used to express necessity and judgment.<br>Example:&nbsp;Il est important que tu dormes. (It’s important that you sleep.)</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Past</strong></h4><p>When to use it: Just as you would use the subjunctive to express doubt, desire, necessity, or judgment, you would use the past subjunctive to talk about those things in the past.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Example:&nbsp;Je ne pensais pas qu’elle soit venue.&nbsp;(I didn’t think she would come.)</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Imperative</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Present</strong></h4><p>When to use it: Use this tense when you want to give an order, make a request, give advice, or express a desire.<br>Example:&nbsp;Parle-moi.

Unlike some other literary tenses, this tense is a bit more common and can even be found in children’s books.<br>The following tenses are also literary tenses, which means you shouldn’t worry about <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learning to conjugate </a>them. However, it might be helpful to recognize them if you want to read French literature.</p><ul><li>Indicative<ul><li>Anterior past: Quand nous eûmes fini, nous partîmes.
