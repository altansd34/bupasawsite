Her father took some pictures of&nbsp;her and thanks to&nbsp;them she managed to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;some commercials. Her first important gig in&nbsp;television was a&nbsp;small part in&nbsp;<i>The Wonderful Years</i>, back in&nbsp;1988, after which came the film that would place her in&nbsp;the public eye: <i>The Crush</i>, in&nbsp;1993.</p><p>In&nbsp;the film, the young woman won the affection of&nbsp;teenage viewers with the role of&nbsp;Adrian Forrester, a&nbsp;girl obsessed with an&nbsp;older man. Alicia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was</a> only 16&nbsp;years old when she was working on&nbsp;the film production and lived alone in&nbsp;an&nbsp;apartment in&nbsp;Vancouver; she had to&nbsp;officially emancipate herself to&nbsp;devote herself to&nbsp;her career full time.</p><p>The actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> that having been independent at&nbsp;such a&nbsp;young age, she probably missed some steps in&nbsp;her emotional development. However, she also realizes that she gained experience and matured earlier than other people her age.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/99a/3c7/5aa2e252e4b4edabafc79526cc.jpg><p>The beautiful actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>caught</a> the world’s attention, including Aerosmith’s, who hired her to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;3&nbsp;of&nbsp;their most successful videos. After that, Alicia became the youth idol of&nbsp;the moment, and at&nbsp;18, she got the opportunity to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;a&nbsp;movie that would change her life.</p><p>The young woman was cast to&nbsp;play Cher Horowitz in&nbsp;<i>Clueless</i>, a&nbsp;rom-com loosely based on&nbsp;Jane Austen’s <i>Emma</i>, although with a&nbsp;much more modern approach. The film was a&nbsp;perfect reflection of&nbsp;the youth society of&nbsp;the ’90s and left a&nbsp;significant mark on&nbsp;pop culture, lasting more than 25&nbsp;years after its release.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f30/9ac/2e684b5d559d83d763a93fccf6.jpg><p>For the star, all that success was unexpected and a&nbsp;bit overwhelming. Her life took a&nbsp;180-degree turn in&nbsp;an&nbsp;industry where she claims she felt isolated. “I&nbsp;didn’t expect the reaction we&nbsp;got at&nbsp;all. It&nbsp;was too much, and I&nbsp;think, if&nbsp;anything, it&nbsp;took me&nbsp;away from doing this work for a&nbsp;while and got me&nbsp;much more into my&nbsp;activism,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a> years later.</p><p>Alicia also acknowledged that she was never interested in&nbsp;being a&nbsp;star. She defined herself as&nbsp;a&nbsp;“theater nerd” who was passionate about her profession and simply wanted to&nbsp;act without aspiring to&nbsp;be&nbsp;world-famous. After <i>Clueless</i>, she became the girl everyone was talking about, and all the directors wanted to&nbsp;have in&nbsp;their cast, but that would soon become a&nbsp;burden.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa6/988/7ee1b559d79bd4da77963506d0.jpg><p>Silverstone was barely 20&nbsp;when she saw a&nbsp;darker side of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>. It&nbsp;made such an&nbsp;impression that she moved away from what she claimed was her great passion. In&nbsp;1997 she landed the role of&nbsp;Batgirl in&nbsp;<i>Batman &&nbsp;Robin</i>. It&nbsp;was possibly one of&nbsp;the most important roles of&nbsp;her career. She’d work with <a href=# title="George Clooney" data-link=tag>George Clooney</a> and Chris O’Donnell. However, critics soon came to&nbsp;demolish her dream. She ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;the spotlight, both for the film’s flop and for her physique.</p><p>Alicia had to&nbsp;put up&nbsp;with being called “fat” and even some nasty nicknames, referring to&nbsp;her character and her tight costume. “They made fun of&nbsp;my&nbsp;body when&nbsp;I was younger. It&nbsp;was painful, but&nbsp;I knew they were wrong. I&nbsp;knew it&nbsp;wasn’t right to&nbsp;make fun of&nbsp;someone’s body shape; it&nbsp;doesn’t seem right to&nbsp;do&nbsp;that to&nbsp;a&nbsp;human being,” the actress <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/351/372/0d85d45b1c8cb6fe1e2b5bb4bf.jpg><p>After this bitter experience, Alicia decided enough was enough and would not bend to&nbsp;the standards of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;cruel industry or&nbsp;try to&nbsp;change her body to&nbsp;fit&nbsp;in. “My&nbsp;response was, ’No.’ I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;being a&nbsp;celebrity or&nbsp;maintaining any fame,” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “If&nbsp;you’re telling me&nbsp;that acting means I’m going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;called fat, and&nbsp;I have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;things a&nbsp;certain way, then I’ll pass.”</p><p>She also acknowledged that she stopped loving acting for a&nbsp;long time, but thanks to&nbsp;a&nbsp;hiatus, she discovered that fame didn’t have to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;the way of&nbsp;her passion or&nbsp;stop her from doing everything she enjoyed about her profession. When she turned&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>30</a>, the actress hired a&nbsp;new agent, encouraging her to&nbsp;take only those roles she felt connected&nbsp;to. She had to&nbsp;turn down many important film and television roles along the way, but she stayed true to&nbsp;her principles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4e0/34a/c71e525cb38f732e2c4e94c3f4.jpg><p>In&nbsp;the meantime, the star discovered that there are other activities that she is&nbsp;passionate about and to&nbsp;which it&nbsp;was worth dedicating her time and energy. Alicia became an&nbsp;activist in&nbsp;the fight for animal rights. Also, after 8&nbsp;years of&nbsp;preparation and planning, she fulfilled another of&nbsp;her dreams: she published a&nbsp;vegan cookbook entitled <i>The Kind Diet</i>.</p><p>Later, she rediscovered her love for acting after being encouraged to&nbsp;appear in&nbsp;a&nbsp;play, <i>Boston Marriage</i>. “I&nbsp;felt that was what&nbsp;I was meant to&nbsp;do, I&nbsp;love it&nbsp;so&nbsp;much; I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;do&nbsp;both, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and an&nbsp;activist at&nbsp;the same time, and that’s what I&nbsp;did,” said the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>performer</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/831/a31/9b6e50543a97ceb4ad4838a7ba.jpg><p>And it&nbsp;seems that she has achieved her purpose since the 45-year-old artist has been very active in&nbsp;acting for the last 10&nbsp;years. She’s worked as&nbsp;n&nbsp;actress and producer of&nbsp;multiple independent films, television, theater, and dubbing projects. Some of&nbsp;them are <i>Bad Therapy</i>, <i>Scream</i>, or&nbsp;<i>American Woman</i>.</p><p>She has also managed to&nbsp;stay away from the spotlight and tabloids by&nbsp;balancing her career as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actress and activist and enjoying her role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;mother. Alicia <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>raises</a> her son Bear, born in&nbsp;2011, on&nbsp;her terms, ignoring the opinions of&nbsp;others. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;word, she deals with other people’s opinions just like she did when critics were talking about her body: by&nbsp;ignoring them.</p><p>Without a&nbsp;doubt, Alicia Silverstone proves that fame and glamour don’t always mean success. She was undeterred by&nbsp;the pressures of&nbsp;the industry to&nbsp;fit into a&nbsp;role she didn’t believe&nbsp;in, and despite staying away from the screen for a&nbsp;while, she managed to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;fall back in&nbsp;love with her profession and get her career back on&nbsp;track.</p><p>When did you have to&nbsp;deal with other people’s judgments, and how did you handle&nbsp;it? What would be&nbsp;the best way to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;more empathetic and kind world, according to&nbsp;you?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK6ttcKimGarmaHDpr7SraannV2ptaZ5mGmqZquklr9uw8eoZKudlqrAprCMraZmmpWjsW7AzmaZnpmlqcZuv9OapZ2ZopnAboSPcW9qbV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
