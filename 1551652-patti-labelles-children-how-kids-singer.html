At just eight years of age, she has already been introduced to the <a href=#>world</a> of fashion, and her grandmother Patti considers her a <a id=https://www.essence.com/fashion/patti-labelle-granddaughter-gia-edwards-instagram/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">little stylish diva</a>.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ad73d4790fbc8f3e.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Billie Eilish’s boyfriend's list: who has the singer dated?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The couple’s second daughter, Leyla, was born on 15 September 2017.

He generally keeps a low profile, and little is known about his early life.</p><p class=align-left>After the 2020 United States presidential election, he was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">embroiled in controversy</a>. A Republican politician, Dean Browning, posted a tweet saying he was a “black gay guy “ who preferred Trump over Obama. There was massive outrage online, and <a href=#>social media</a> users posited that he had forgotten to use his fake account, where he pretended to be someone else. He responded by saying he had accidentally posted the message, which was sent to him by a mystery man named Dan Purdy.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after, Holte posted a video saying Browning’s statement was true, confirming that he was Dan Purdy. However, social media users quickly traced his online footprint and found his true identity as William Holte. As the backlash reached LaBelle, she stated that although she disagreed with his political inclinations, he was her family, and <a id=https://thegrio.com/2020/12/17/labelle-holte-purdy-trump/ href=# rel="nofollow noopener">she loved him</a>.
