He&nbsp;hasn’t shied away from expressing in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;me&nbsp;and to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;never loved anyone like he&nbsp;loved his wife, and how all his past <a href=# title=relationships data-link=tag>relationships</a> pale in&nbsp;comparison. And that includes my&nbsp;mom who was his first wife, who left him widowed with an&nbsp;8-year-old son at&nbsp;the time.</p><p>To&nbsp;make it&nbsp;even more difficult to&nbsp;hear. The vow renewal was held on&nbsp;my&nbsp;18th birthday and&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;celebrate my&nbsp;birthday by&nbsp;hearing Dad talk about how mom meant nothing because his second wife was so&nbsp;much better. They had been married for 8&nbsp;years at&nbsp;the time. But a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;<a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and friends didn’t attend their actual wedding and they decided they’d have a&nbsp;second one to&nbsp;celebrate and they decided my&nbsp;birthday was the perfect time to&nbsp;do&nbsp;this.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/426/14c/8667e8596e8d2cd6f5070c0e64.jpg><p>“Anyway, the speech he&nbsp;wrote for my&nbsp;wedding had a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;this content from what my&nbsp;aunt heard from my&nbsp;dad and read herself. She knew on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding day the last thing&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;hear was how much he&nbsp;adores his wife when he&nbsp;does so&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that said my&nbsp;mom meant nothing to&nbsp;him.</p><p>I&nbsp;told him&nbsp;I knew about the speech and he&nbsp;didn’t have permission to&nbsp;give the speech at&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding. Dad asked why not and&nbsp;I told him&nbsp;I didn’t want him to&nbsp;use my&nbsp;wedding to&nbsp;praise his wife. He&nbsp;said she means the world to&nbsp;us so&nbsp;why would&nbsp;I say that? I&nbsp;told him she meant the world to&nbsp;him. But she pales in&nbsp;comparison to&nbsp;my&nbsp;mom who meant the world to&nbsp;me&nbsp;and still does. I&nbsp;told him he&nbsp;might have decided Mom meant nothing but that didn’t mean&nbsp;I shared his feelings. He&nbsp;accused me&nbsp;of&nbsp;being sensitive and then said it&nbsp;seemed like&nbsp;I didn’t care about his wife at&nbsp;all, and then he&nbsp;said she was a&nbsp;good mom to&nbsp;me&nbsp;for the 8&nbsp;years she raised&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;told him she was never anything more than his wife.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34d/1ea/6a94d65cc3a0baab35ba4fc8b4.jpg><p>“My&nbsp;mom died when&nbsp;I was 8&nbsp;and&nbsp;I didn’t get a&nbsp;new one. And the last thing&nbsp;I need to&nbsp;hear is&nbsp;how little she meant on&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding day. Dad told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;reasonable and the parents of&nbsp;the bride and groom typically say something. I&nbsp;told him nothing he&nbsp;had to&nbsp;say had a&nbsp;place at&nbsp;my&nbsp;wedding. That this is&nbsp;mine and my&nbsp;fiancée’s wedding, not his. I&nbsp;told him to&nbsp;get married again if&nbsp;all he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;do&nbsp;was praise his wife. But it&nbsp;was not happening at&nbsp;mine.</p><p>He&nbsp;told me&nbsp;to&nbsp;stop acting like a&nbsp;little boy and grow&nbsp;up. I&nbsp;left.
