She wasn’t lying, as she went on to create a series of wildlife sounds that had the panel and audience initially confused but ultimately wowed.</p><p>Geneviève also showed off a powerful singing voice during her performance. Mandel jumped to his feet when it was over, along with much of the crowd. Geneviève was emotional as she received a chorus of applause.</p><p>“I have always had an issue with the fact that I was forced, forced, to leave Canada to go do what I wanted to do,” Mandel told Geneviève. “My biggest dream is to find something that we haven’t seen before. Something that will say, ‘This is this person from Canada. This is a talent.’ And you know what? This is the moment that it happened for me.”</p><p>Mandel proceeded to hit the Golden Buzzer for Geneviève’s audition. She was emotional over receiving the honor, as her boyfriend and friend joined her on stage to celebrate.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HOW TO VOTE FOR YOUR FAVORITE CONTESTANTS ON ‘CANADA’S GOT TALENT’ 2023</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mandel-recently-teased-the-moment>Mandel Recently Teased the Moment</h3><p>Mandel’s Golden Buzzer might not have come as much of a surprise to some viewers, as he <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">teased which act</a> received the honor from him in a recent podcast appearance.
