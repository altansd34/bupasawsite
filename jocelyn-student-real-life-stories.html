Scotland is the home of the music that I play, the traditional music scene here is so vibrant and there are so many amazing musicians. The scenery is beautiful the castles the the ocean the water there's so much to explore and Scotland has so&nbsp;much to offer.</p><p>It has been an amazing experience my year has been so special I've had so many&nbsp; memorable experiences both at the Conservatoire and through meeting so many wonderful new friends and collaborators from around the world. I've had the honour of performing at several festivals throughout Scotland also performances in Brussels, Belgium representing the Royal Conservatoire for Robert Burns day at Scotland House and the UK ambassador's residence and recently a performance for His Royal Highness Prince Charles when he came so that was a huge honour.</p><p>My future plans include returning to Canada over the summer to record and perform and put music that I've created here doing this year into my third album and then I will be coming back to Scotland in the fall and I look forward to more experiences here. The support has been amazing I've just felt really at home with people from all over the world and meeting&nbsp;friends from so many different countries there's a very vibrant international community at the Conservatoire and it's wonderful to celebrate that multiculturalism and that diversity.</p><p>My message would be come to Scotland it's a beautiful country the people are so friendly and welcoming and there's so much to explore and to see here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FOraOappRjvLOzjq%2BgnZ2fYsGzrc2smquhoKl8q7vCnqOypl2owbawxKerZqqVlrluuMifnGarpKS%2FqrHS</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
