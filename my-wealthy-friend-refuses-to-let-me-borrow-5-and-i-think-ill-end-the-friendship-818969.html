My best friend and I have been friends for nearly 7 years. When we first met, she was struggling financially and lived paycheck to paycheck. At one point, her car broke down, and she had no transportation to work, so I would let her borrow my car and never asked her for gas money or anything in return."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

When we&nbsp;first met, she was struggling financially and lived paycheck to&nbsp;paycheck. At&nbsp;one point, her car broke down, and she had no&nbsp;transportation to&nbsp;work, so&nbsp;I would let her borrow my&nbsp;car and never asked her for gas <a href=# title=money data-link=tag>money</a> or&nbsp;anything in&nbsp;return. At&nbsp;the time, I&nbsp;was financially secure and was happy to&nbsp;help her out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e91/d96/b2fa7d5fffb1748d7eef122fbd.jpg><p>As&nbsp;the years went&nbsp;by, my&nbsp;financial situation changed and just like her, I&nbsp;began living paycheck to&nbsp;paycheck. By&nbsp;this time, she had started dating a&nbsp;guy she met online, who revealed to&nbsp;her a&nbsp;few months into dating that he&nbsp;was a&nbsp;millionaire. They married shortly after, and suffice to&nbsp;say she has not had to&nbsp;struggle since.</p><p>There have been a&nbsp;few times&nbsp;I have asked to&nbsp;borrow money, which&nbsp;I have always paid back. It’s usually not much, less than $25&nbsp;or so&nbsp;each time, and she would always oblige with no&nbsp;problems until recently.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e09/f8d/31b3765ea986b85a8768bc2575.jpg><p>The last couple of&nbsp;times&nbsp;I asked to&nbsp;borrow money, she said she didn’t have&nbsp;it, which&nbsp;I found odd. But then&nbsp;I asked to&nbsp;borrow&nbsp;$5, and she said the same thing, and&nbsp;I thought it&nbsp;was odd that she told me&nbsp;she didn’t have $5&nbsp;to&nbsp;spare. I&nbsp;know that ever since she got married, her brothers and a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;other friends have tried taking advantage of&nbsp;her new-found wealth by&nbsp;asking to&nbsp;borrow money they never paid back and having her bail them out of&nbsp;situations they put themselves in&nbsp;that have cost her a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;money.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f8c/241/fa4a6752f7a6fbbb0926290385.jpg><p>I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;think that maybe&nbsp;I had forgotten to&nbsp;pay her back the money&nbsp;I owed her at&nbsp;some point, so&nbsp;I reached out to&nbsp;her to&nbsp;ask if&nbsp;that was the case. When she told me&nbsp;that wasn’t the case (as&nbsp;in, I&nbsp;had always paid her back), I&nbsp;told her&nbsp;I felt hurt because it&nbsp;felt as&nbsp;if&nbsp;I needed her help with something (I&nbsp;used the example if&nbsp;I ended up&nbsp;in&nbsp;jail) that&nbsp;I couldn’t reach out to&nbsp;her for help because she couldn’t even let me&nbsp;borrow $5.</p><p>She replied and said that, just like her brothers, I&nbsp;needed to&nbsp;learn how to&nbsp;budget my&nbsp;money better and that she couldn’t be&nbsp;the one to&nbsp;bail everyone out. She said when she was struggling, she had to&nbsp;work multiple jobs and did what she had to&nbsp;do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/aa5/85a/4d921f5be6942766f40d1121c1.jpg><p>I&nbsp;replied and said that it&nbsp;was not fair for her to&nbsp;lump me&nbsp;in&nbsp;with her brothers as&nbsp;I have never done anything to&nbsp;take advantage of&nbsp;her and&nbsp;I have never said something like that to&nbsp;her when&nbsp;I let her borrow my&nbsp;car and anytime she would ask me&nbsp;to&nbsp;borrow money when she was struggling. I&nbsp;told her&nbsp;I loved her but that&nbsp;I was ending the conversation, and she replied that this is&nbsp;why money and friends should never mixed.</p><p>Since then, she has reached out and said, “I&nbsp;didn’t deserve that conversation last night, I&nbsp;hope you know that” to&nbsp;which&nbsp;I have not replied and have no&nbsp;plans&nbsp;to. I&nbsp;am deeply hurt that she feels&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;the wrong, but I&nbsp;do not think&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;the wrong here. I&nbsp;understand that I&nbsp;am not entitled to&nbsp;anyone’s money, borrowed or&nbsp;not, but when she was in&nbsp;my&nbsp;shoes, I&nbsp;did everything&nbsp;I could to&nbsp;help her out. I&nbsp;could understand if&nbsp;I had asked to&nbsp;borrow a&nbsp;large amount of&nbsp;money, but&nbsp;I literally asked for&nbsp;$5.</p><p><h2>People got mixed reactions.</h2></p><ul><li>“I’d leave her&nbsp;be.

This is&nbsp;over you frequently asking her friend for money. It&nbsp;doesn’t matter if&nbsp;you always pay her back. It’s that no&nbsp;one wants to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used for money. And the friend already has a&nbsp;bad taste in&nbsp;her mouth due to&nbsp;her brothers, so&nbsp;everyone paying the consequences of&nbsp;the money well running dry to&nbsp;any and everyone.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Nina_Rae_____&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1db/620/1ee18b5d7db5d971d20f0cfc5d.jpg><ul><li>“Friendships are founded on&nbsp;equality.
