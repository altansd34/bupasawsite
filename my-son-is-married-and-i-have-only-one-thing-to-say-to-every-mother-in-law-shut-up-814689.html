It’s the advice, my&nbsp;mother gave me&nbsp;about being a&nbsp;mother-in-law. It’s simple and easy to&nbsp;remember, “Keep your mouth shut, it’s none of&nbsp;your business!”</p><p>I’m serious, your son picked this woman. He&nbsp;has pledged to&nbsp;support her above all others (that means you). You went to&nbsp;the wedding and sat there and voiced no&nbsp;objection. Basically you pledged to&nbsp;support their <a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a>. You pledged to&nbsp;acknowledge and support their union.</p><p>Those <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> she is&nbsp;parenting are not yours, they are hers and his. What they do&nbsp;and how they choose to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;none of&nbsp;your business. Now, having said that, if&nbsp;there is&nbsp;violence then you have an&nbsp;obligation to&nbsp;speak&nbsp;up. Otherwise, keep your mouth shut.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4b9/e4d/77c6c853c587d1fda14d1464e3.jpg><p>The first opportunity&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;follow my&nbsp;mother’s sage advice was at&nbsp;their rehearsal dinner. Her father was sitting across the dinner table from my&nbsp;daughter-in-law and&nbsp;me. He&nbsp;said, “I&nbsp;can’t wait for the grand babies!”</p><p>She blushed and asked me&nbsp;where&nbsp;I stood on&nbsp;the subject. I&nbsp;asked her if&nbsp;she wanted an&nbsp;honest answer. She said yes. Here is&nbsp;the answer&nbsp;I gave her.</p><p>“Frankly, it’s none of&nbsp;my&nbsp;business. It’s your marriage to&nbsp;your husband, the two of&nbsp;you are the only ones who can say when it’s right for you to&nbsp;have kids. So&nbsp;don’t let anyone pressure you.” She smiled and said, “Thank you, I’ll remember that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/cde/a93/ad5f0c5b27a1246cb9b6c281ba.jpg><p>They have two kids now, and&nbsp;I babysit a&nbsp;lot. Do&nbsp;they do&nbsp;some things differently than I&nbsp;would? Sure they&nbsp;do. Times change! Do&nbsp;I&nbsp;say anything, usually not.</p><p>If&nbsp;I&nbsp;think it’s important&nbsp;I tell my&nbsp;son privately. Then he&nbsp;can ignore&nbsp;it, or&nbsp;they can discuss it&nbsp;or&nbsp;what ever they want to&nbsp;do. I&nbsp;never bring it&nbsp;up&nbsp;again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/86f/9b3/15847e5ecbbeb275ab79fd1bb6.jpg><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result&nbsp;I have a&nbsp;great <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> with my&nbsp;son’s lovely, talented, smart, beautiful wife. I’m welcome in&nbsp;their home, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;matter of&nbsp;fact she gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;key and said stop by&nbsp;any time.</p><p>If&nbsp;you want a&nbsp;place in&nbsp;their lives, shut&nbsp;up!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c8d/7c5/d7bec454638781600818de524d.jpg><p>This post caused turmoil online. However, almost all followers agreed that this mother-in-law’s approach is&nbsp;correct and adequate.</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;would love to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;mother-in-law like you. Unfortunately, mine is&nbsp;the polar opposite.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Crystal Gillis&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>My&nbsp;mother-in-law hated me&nbsp;from sight, for no&nbsp;good reason. What she didn’t know was that we&nbsp;were already living together and planning a&nbsp;wedding. We&nbsp;were married 2&nbsp;months later without her knowing. We&nbsp;are 20&nbsp;years strong today. She still hates&nbsp;me.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Shelley Foxwell-Brenneman&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>Thank you. My&nbsp;daughter-in-law is&nbsp;wonderful, I’m a&nbsp;lucky mother-in-law, and my&nbsp;son is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very lucky man.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Ann McConnell&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;mother-in-law like that! She gave me&nbsp;a&nbsp;golden piece of&nbsp;advice&nbsp;— really a&nbsp;request. She said, “When you and my&nbsp;son have a&nbsp;fight, which you will, come to&nbsp;me. I’ll probably agree with you, simply because&nbsp;I know him and&nbsp;I married his father! But please don’t go&nbsp;to&nbsp;your family with&nbsp;it. They will probably agree with you, too, but they will always hold it&nbsp;against him, while I’ll still love him because he’s my&nbsp;son.”<br>That’s exactly what I&nbsp;did. I&nbsp;never told my&nbsp;family any of&nbsp;our troubles. They were, and are private. This is&nbsp;the 42nd year of&nbsp;our marriage.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Gwen Croom&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>I&nbsp;wish&nbsp;I had a&nbsp;mother-in-law like this! Mine refused to&nbsp;come to&nbsp;our wedding, pitched a&nbsp;fit and yelled in&nbsp;my&nbsp;hospital room a&nbsp;few hours after&nbsp;I gave birth, told my&nbsp;husband to&nbsp;never sign a&nbsp;mortgage with me&nbsp;because it&nbsp;would make it&nbsp;too difficult for him to&nbsp;leave, and so&nbsp;many more things&nbsp;I can’t even think of&nbsp;at&nbsp;the moment.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Adri Hardie&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li><li>Some wise person once said, “Never pass up&nbsp;a&nbsp;good opportunity to&nbsp;shut&nbsp;up.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Steve Dutch&nbsp;/ Quora</a></li></ul><p>But on&nbsp;another story, people’s opinions were divided. <a href=#>This mom</a> made her 11-year-old daughter get eyelash extensions and blew up&nbsp;the <a href=# title=internet data-link=tag>internet</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6edKopWaho2K6or7RopydZZGjsW61jKGYr51dpLutxYyopZ5lpJ22r7OMraZmq5GuerW7jJ6tnqqpYrqwwMeeqWahnmK5osOMrJ%2BurF2qvW6EkG1tcXFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
