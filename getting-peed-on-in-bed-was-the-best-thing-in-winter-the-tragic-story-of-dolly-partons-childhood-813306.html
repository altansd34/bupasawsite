In&nbsp;this article, we’ll tell you one of&nbsp;the most inspiring rags-to-riches stories.</p><p><h2>She already had “her own baby” at&nbsp;9&nbsp;years old.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/baf/ef0/9effce5540b4148cb34a2daef1.jpg><p>Dolly and her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>11</a>&nbsp;siblings had a&nbsp;rough <a href=# title=childhood data-link=tag>childhood</a>. Each older child had to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the younger one, and Larry Parton was her responsibility when she was only 9&nbsp;years old.</p><p>“My&nbsp;mother used to&nbsp;say, ’This one’s gonna be&nbsp;your <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>baby</a>,’” she recollects. “That meant that you got to&nbsp;take extra care of&nbsp;it. You have got to&nbsp;get up&nbsp;with it&nbsp;at&nbsp;night and rock it&nbsp;back and forth.” Larry passed away <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>4&nbsp;days</a> after his birth, and it&nbsp;deeply affected Dolly, and she’s never fully come to&nbsp;terms with the pain.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was always cold in&nbsp;the house.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/741/ffc/a2a50f54b4933ba68dfba664b8.jpg><p>Winter was particularly hard for the family, “Daddy wouldn’t let&nbsp;us get up&nbsp;until he’d built a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fire</a> and had it&nbsp;going. I&nbsp;remember&nbsp;us saying, ‘Daddy, is&nbsp;the fire hot?’ It&nbsp;wasn’t uncommon for snow to&nbsp;get into the house through the cracks in&nbsp;the walls. It&nbsp;would get so&nbsp;cold that the family would have to&nbsp;thaw water to&nbsp;use from the water bucket in&nbsp;the kitchen.”</p><p><h2>They wet the bed to&nbsp;warm&nbsp;up.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/95c/b26/1a23535c48858823eaa213f22c.jpg><p>Up&nbsp;to&nbsp;3&nbsp;or 4&nbsp;children would sleep together each night. When someone wet the bed, Dolly wouldn’t even change the sheets during the night.</p><p>She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>explained</a>, “That was the only warm thing we&nbsp;knew in&nbsp;the winter time. That was almost a&nbsp;pleasure to&nbsp;get peed on&nbsp;because it&nbsp;was so&nbsp;cold. If&nbsp;you kept the air out from under the cover, the pee didn’t get so&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cold</a>. When you started fanning that cover, then it&nbsp;got bad, cold.”</p><p><h2>They had a&nbsp;pan of&nbsp;water instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;bathtub.</h2></p><p>Bathing or&nbsp;showering wasn’t available to&nbsp;the family as&nbsp;they lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;one-bedroom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>cabin</a> without electricity or&nbsp;running water. The only thing they had was a&nbsp;pan of&nbsp;water. During the winter, Parton and her siblings had to&nbsp;wash themselves <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>every day</a> because they would wet the bed and then wear the same clothes to&nbsp;school. The star <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>says</a>, “I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;bath every night to&nbsp;be&nbsp;clean, ’cause the kids peed on&nbsp;me&nbsp;every night.”</p><p><h2>She almost lost 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;her toes.</h2></p><p>Even Dolly’s injuries were quite remarkable, much like her life as&nbsp;a&nbsp;whole. Rather than just scraping her knee, Parton’s injuries almost resulted in&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>loss</a> of&nbsp;toes.</p><p>When she was 6&nbsp;or 7&nbsp;years old, she nearly lost 3&nbsp;of&nbsp;them after jumping onto a&nbsp;broken mason jar. Her mother acted quickly and sewed her toes back&nbsp;on, using <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>kerosene</a> as&nbsp;an&nbsp;anesthetic. It&nbsp;may sound terrifying, but her toes healed, and she still uses them to&nbsp;walk today.</p><p><h2>She loves her family and childhood.</h2></p><p>Despite the cramped living conditions, her house still holds a&nbsp;special place in&nbsp;Parton’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>heart</a>. Her mother, Avie Lee, managed to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the large family while instilling in&nbsp;them the value of&nbsp;making the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>most</a> of&nbsp;what they had. Even though her father, Robert Lee, was illiterate, she fondly recalls him as&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>intelligent</a> people she’s ever met, who worked hard to&nbsp;support his family. Her father even offered a&nbsp;bag of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grain</a> to&nbsp;a&nbsp;doctor to&nbsp;deliver Dolly when they couldn’t afford the medical fees.</p><p><h2>Her music career took off.</h2></p><p>When Dolly Parton was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>10</a>&nbsp;years old, she started showcasing her singing and guitar skills on&nbsp;TV and radio shows. In&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>1959</a>, at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;13, she was introduced to&nbsp;the stage at&nbsp;the Grand Ole Opry by&nbsp;Johnny Cash. Her performance was well received. After graduating from high school, Dolly headed to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Nashville</a>, where her successful music career took off.</p><p><h2>She’s grateful for everything she’s experienced.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc4/07d/7383d152009aa0df01c63c4f83.jpg><p>Buena Vista Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection/East News<span>, </span>Richard Shotwell/Invision/East News</p><p>Dolly learned to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>grateful</a>, thankful, and show empathy to&nbsp;everyone. The star says she was never intimidated by&nbsp;wealthy people and always felt she could belong anywhere, even though she didn’t always know how to&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;spoon correctly.</p><p>“I&nbsp;just <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>never</a> felt out of&nbsp;place, because&nbsp;I was always self-contained and comfortable with who I&nbsp;was. I&nbsp;accept everybody for who they are. I’m not a&nbsp;judgmental person. I&nbsp;love everybody. I&nbsp;really&nbsp;do.”</p><p>Despite so&nbsp;many struggles Dolly looks as&nbsp;fresh as&nbsp;a&nbsp;daisy. We&nbsp;discovered how she manages to&nbsp;stay so&nbsp;<a href=#>youthful</a> at&nbsp;77&nbsp;years old and her secrets are genius.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLSmwNOipaBloJqypXnOp2Sipl2XsqV51pqqZqyYmnqjsdKtZK2gmaO0brXNZq6ipqSav27Ax55kraqRnLakedKtpquxXaSzbrDOpaOyZaCWv7W7zaxknKCZobGpu86dZHFpY2h9d3s%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
