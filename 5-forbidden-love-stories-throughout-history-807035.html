Cleopatra and Mark Antony</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/450/b18/3c2300579a8883157ecd770395.jpg><p>Let’s place ourselves in&nbsp;the lives of&nbsp;the famous queen of&nbsp;Egypt <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Cleopatra</a> and the powerful Roman general <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mark Antony</a>. The union of&nbsp;these governors started for convenience and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>political advancement</a>, but what started as&nbsp;an&nbsp;alliance soon turned into love. However, the couple was separated because Mark had to&nbsp;marry the sister of&nbsp;the Roman ruler, Octavian.</p><p>Despite being married, Mark was still in&nbsp;love with <a href=# title=Cleopatra data-link=tag>Cleopatra</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>after three years</a> apart they were reunited and continued their affair. Mark divorced Octavian’s sister, so&nbsp;the angry Roman ruler <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>declared war</a> on&nbsp;Cleopatra. Despite their efforts, the couple lost the war and took <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>their own lives</a>. Octavian decided to&nbsp;honor Cleopatra’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>last wish</a>, which was to&nbsp;be&nbsp;buried side by&nbsp;side with the love of&nbsp;her life, Mark Antony.</p><p><h2>2. Prince Edward and Wallis Simpson</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2e0/231/a3080551c9a3dd40148979945f.jpg><p>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;royals, there are different sets of&nbsp;rules and etiquette that they must follow to&nbsp;keep their titles and positions. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Edward, Prince of&nbsp;Wales</a>, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Wallis Simpson</a>, an&nbsp;American aristocrat, met while she was married. The couple and the prince were close friends, but Edward and Wallis quickly fell in&nbsp;love. Edward’s father, King George&nbsp;V, died during that time, so&nbsp;Edward <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>was proclaimed king</a> of&nbsp;the United Kingdom.</p><p>Wallis decided to&nbsp;get her now second divorce, while King Edward tried to&nbsp;gain acceptance for her with the royal <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> and the church. But their union was met with strong opposition, so&nbsp;King Edward had to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>abdicate the crown</a> in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Wallis. While announcing his abdication, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Edward said</a>: “I&nbsp;have found it&nbsp;impossible to&nbsp;carry the heavy burden of&nbsp;responsibility and to&nbsp;discharge my&nbsp;duties as&nbsp;King as&nbsp;I would wish to&nbsp;do&nbsp;without the help and support of&nbsp;the woman I&nbsp;love.”</p><p><h2>3. Richard and Mildred Loving</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bc3/0a3/6810075484a8a62c777378b806.png><p>The Lovings’ love story made history in&nbsp;America, and it&nbsp;will probably be&nbsp;in&nbsp;textbooks one day. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Richard</a> was a&nbsp;white construction worker of&nbsp;Irish and English descent, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Mildred</a> was of&nbsp;African American and Native American descent. Their relationship was <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>forbidden</a> by&nbsp;the laws of&nbsp;their home state, Virginia, since “interracial” marriages weren’t allowed. So, the Lovings <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>had to</a>&nbsp;abandon their home for fear of&nbsp;incarceration.</p><p>However, Mildred and Richard loved their hometown and wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back, so&nbsp;they decided to&nbsp;take their case to&nbsp;the Supreme Court. The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>ruling of&nbsp;the Supreme Court</a> in&nbsp;favor of&nbsp;the Lovings was unanimous, so&nbsp;they could return home and raise their children together as&nbsp;a&nbsp;married couple. In&nbsp;the end, Mildred and Richard’s courageous love helped to&nbsp;end segregation laws all over America.</p><p><h2>4. Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/043/774/bb41e6565c88d4af70247093c1.png><p>The reason this couple couldn’t be&nbsp;together was also the color of&nbsp;their skin, but just like the Lovings, they had a&nbsp;happy ending. Seretse Khama was the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Chief Designate of&nbsp;the Bamangwato Tribe,</a> and Ruth was a&nbsp;white working Englishwoman. The couple met opposition to&nbsp;their union from Seretse’s tribe, the English government, and Ruth’s father. Nevertheless, the couple married in&nbsp;1948.</p><p>For years, Seretse and Ruth were <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>exiled </a>from his native country, and to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;return, Seretse had to&nbsp;renounce his chieftainship for him and his heirs. Seretse left his title to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with Ruth and their children. The once chief returned home with his family as&nbsp;an&nbsp;ordinary citizen, but years later, Seretse became the first president of&nbsp;Botswana.</p><p><h2>5. Theodora and Justinian&nbsp;I</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2a0/d1d/f3b5395e56a10100b8f865f4d0.jpg><p>Let’s travel way back in&nbsp;time, and imagine ourselves in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the Byzantine Empire, when Emperor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Justinian</a> was a&nbsp;powerful emperor. At&nbsp;the time, being an&nbsp;actress was frowned upon by&nbsp;society, but that didn’t stop our emperor from falling in&nbsp;love with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Theodora</a>, a&nbsp;young actress. The law prohibited men of&nbsp;rank to&nbsp;marry a&nbsp;performer, so&nbsp;as&nbsp;an&nbsp;act of&nbsp;love he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>changed</a> said law, and married her anyway.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;her intelligence, Theodora became Justinian’s most trusted advisor and co-ruler. Together, they became powerful and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wise governors</a>. They reformed Rome’s entire law system; some of&nbsp;the new laws they created focused on&nbsp;improving <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>women’s rights</a>. Many years later, Theodora passed away, so&nbsp;Justinian kept reigning by&nbsp;himself; he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>never remarried</a>.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you think ’forbidden’ relationships can exist nowadays?
