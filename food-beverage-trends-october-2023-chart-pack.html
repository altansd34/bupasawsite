These charts are powered by Morning Consult’s robust tracking of the industry through a monthly survey of U.S. adults.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0"><strong>Chart Pack highlights:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul class="list-disc pl-m"><li class="mb-s last:mb-0"><strong>Despite cooling inflation, consumers remain concerned about the price of groceries. </strong>About 4 in 5 U.S. adults said they are concerned about the cost of meat (82%), produce (80%) and dairy products (76%) in September 2023, on par with their concerns at the same time last year.</li><li class="mb-s last:mb-0"><strong>There is a slight gender divide in plans for healthy eating and drinking. </strong>Women (65%) are slightly more likely than men (58%) to say they plan on choosing healthier food and drinks over the next month. Healthy eating may be a higher priority for women than men, but a majority of men are also setting a goal to eat healthier.&nbsp;</li><li class="mb-s last:mb-0"><strong>Households with children are more likely to eat fast food on a weekly basis than those without.</strong> Nearly half (49%) of households with children under 18 said they purchased food from a quick-service or fast food establishment at least once a week over the past month compared with 26% of households without children. Parents may rely more on fast food for its convenience, especially as they juggle busier schedules that come with the start of the school year.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6vrcuyqq1lopq9sL7TrGafp5%2BZeqOx1Z6pmp%2BVYsGzsc2dqmank6m8o7HRZmlpamNisKmt0a1kqZmToA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
