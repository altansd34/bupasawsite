And I just couldn’t bring myself to what everyone else says, and what you’re supposed to do, apparently,” Smith said, referring to euthanasia. She tearfully explained that Legend “does not deserve that” and “could do really great with a family that doesn’t have small children.”</p><p>Smith asked her followers for their help, as she wanted to avoid sending Legend to a shelter. She asked if anyone in the Nashville area was able to give the dog a home immediately. Smith emphasized that Legend is “not aggressive towards adults at all.”</p><p>She was also sure to let her followers know that Indigo will be okay, and he will have minimal scarring from the injury.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MORGAN WALLEN SHARES HOW BECOMING A FATHER CHANGED HIM</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-dog-will-be-going-to-a-new-home>The Dog Will Be Going to a New Home</h2><p>Smith shared her work phone number on Instagram stories, asking followers to only text her if they knew of a good home for Legend. Several hours later, she posted an update about the situation, saying they they dropped the dog off “with the sweetest family.”</p><p>She went on to write that Legend “will be living out his full potential and best life on a farm.” Smith said she “couldn’t have asked for a better family for him to be loved on by.” Since the family is in East Tennessee, they’ll also be able to visit Legend.</p><p>Smith thanked her followers “for helping but also for crying with me and lifting me up.” Wallen hasn’t commented publicly on the situation.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Iam-Tongi-American-Idol1-220x146.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Winner Iam Tongi Performs Heartfelt Father’s Day Tribute" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>morgan wallen</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zKipoJmeYsSiuMuepaxlYmLGpq3RZqalnF2ovK95xp6rrGWjqba1r8eeqmaZlqmys3nDqJ5mmpmpsrR5x6KkaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
