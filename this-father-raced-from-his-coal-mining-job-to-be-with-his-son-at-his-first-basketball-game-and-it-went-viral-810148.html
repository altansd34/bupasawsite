They are a&nbsp;close-knit American family that leads a&nbsp;basic and humble lifestyle. Michael is&nbsp;a&nbsp;coal miner and a&nbsp;caring parent who strives to&nbsp;provide his family with the best life possible. He&nbsp;constantly sacrifices for his wife and children, prioritizing their needs over his own.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1e6/c71/64d17957129256f295d6373744.jpg><p>Michael was going about his usual business when he&nbsp;received an&nbsp;unexpected outpouring of&nbsp;love and support from people who had seen his pictures on&nbsp;social media. “We’re just a&nbsp;small Eastern Kentucky family. To&nbsp;see how it’s impacted everyone has been very touching for Michael and for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;see what it&nbsp;means<strong> just because he’s a&nbsp;good dad</strong>,” Molly <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;hurried from work to&nbsp;give his kid an&nbsp;amazing experience.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b7f/d27/a17d955faa94baa640aadff0f4.jpg><p>Michael dedicates his entire life to&nbsp;guiding and helping his children, but because of&nbsp;his hard and irregular work schedule, he’s had to&nbsp;miss several meaningful family occasions. But when they purchased a&nbsp;ticket to&nbsp;see the “Blue &&nbsp;White Scrimmage” at&nbsp;the Appalachian Wireless Arena in&nbsp;October <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2022</a>, he&nbsp;did everything he&nbsp;could to&nbsp;be&nbsp;there with his wife and son, Easton.</p><p>Despite just finishing his work shift, still dressed in&nbsp;his work uniform and covered in&nbsp;soot from head to&nbsp;toe, Michael made it&nbsp;in&nbsp;time for the basketball game. He&nbsp;might have had dirt on&nbsp;his face, but he&nbsp;was determined to&nbsp;give his kid an&nbsp;unforgettable moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fa6/c4b/abf90e54428c7a29225c626ca7.jpg><p>While there, a&nbsp;Kentucky supporter took a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the father and son and shared it&nbsp;online, showing the tender moment between Michael and Easton. In&nbsp;an&nbsp;effort to&nbsp;trace the family and attract the staff’s attention, Sue Kinneer took the photo and wrote in&nbsp;her <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>post</a>, “I&nbsp;don’t know who this guy&nbsp;is, but he&nbsp;has my&nbsp;vote for the ’father of&nbsp;the year.’ He&nbsp;obviously just got off from work and brought his little boy straight to&nbsp;the Blue-White game!”</p><p>Her goal was to&nbsp;honor this father for his worthwhile deed, but she was pleasantly surprised by&nbsp;how well her idea worked.</p><p><h2>Many people can identify with Michael’s acts.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/18f/113/5e88a4501abff4965f377c0b1a.jpg><p>When such a&nbsp;good gesture hits people’s hearts and souls, they may be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;relate to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and feel connected to&nbsp;other people’s experiences. Even the head coach of&nbsp;the Wildcats, John Calipari, saw the picture of&nbsp;Michael’s grimy yet joyful grin. Calipari <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>noticed</a> the dad and shared a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;him on&nbsp;social media to&nbsp;show his admiration for McGuire’s commitment to&nbsp;his family while working hard.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/666/08b/5587b5535e81a01b8686621467.jpg><p>Michael’s work inspired Calipari, who confessed that his relatives were also coal miners. The coach <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrote</a>, “My&nbsp;family’s American dream started in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Clarksburg, WV&nbsp;coal mine. From what I’ve been told, he&nbsp;raced to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with his son after his shift and watch our team. Don’t know who this&nbsp;is, but&nbsp;I have tickets for him and his family at&nbsp;Rupp to&nbsp;be&nbsp;treated as&nbsp;VIPs.”</p><p><h2>For Michael, the outpouring of&nbsp;love and support came as&nbsp;a&nbsp;surprise.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/5e3/4b1/62ad4458e796924e69ab0254c3.jpg><p>Michael is&nbsp;a&nbsp;quiet and genuine man, so&nbsp;when word of&nbsp;him hurrying from work to&nbsp;be&nbsp;with his son spread, he&nbsp;was taken aback. Kentucky fans quickly turned him into a&nbsp;<a href=# title=hero data-link=tag>hero</a>, and Michael had no&nbsp;idea any of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was going&nbsp;on. “When I&nbsp;got out and got service on&nbsp;my&nbsp;way home, it&nbsp;went crazy, and&nbsp;I couldn’t believe it&nbsp;was real,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><p>Even his wife was surprised by&nbsp;the flood of&nbsp;affection, sharing <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>words</a> of&nbsp;love for him, saying, “It&nbsp;doesn’t matter to&nbsp;him how long he&nbsp;has worked or&nbsp;how hard his day&nbsp;is. He&nbsp;is&nbsp;always there and shows up&nbsp;for our babies! He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most selfless man ever and always puts his family first!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/850/780/c0b7b254de8c8c0773d14c1e30.jpg><p>As&nbsp;promised by&nbsp;the coach, he&nbsp;invited the entire family to&nbsp;another basketball game, and Michael was the star of&nbsp;the evening. Although the father was properly dressed and all clean this time, everyone in&nbsp;attendance at&nbsp;the game will never forget him as&nbsp;the devoted father who would do&nbsp;just about anything to&nbsp;ensure his children’s happiness.</p><p>What’s the most generous thing you’ve ever done for someone you care about?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGptdJmnZqsmJq%2Fbr7AnJydZZanvK55x6KqZpuflrluucinoKefXZ%2B8o3nTqGSbnV2strW0jKGgrGWjpLturdNmn6KrXZu2s7%2FTZpmaq5uawaOty6VkoJmdmnqiusNmoK1lp5q7tXnVoqmapF1tfnF9k3Fm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
