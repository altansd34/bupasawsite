In 1977 nine out of ten of the biggest hits were original movies, while in 2014 there was just one. Most of the profitable movies now are sequals, reboots and franchises – 2014 saw another X-Men, another Spider-Man, another Hobbit, another Planet of the Apes... and the list goes on.</p><p><strong><a href=#>See the full poll results</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkwLCvyJ6rsmeRp8Gqr8ueqmhpY2iGd3nNqKueZaCnvKXBwp6prGWgmr%2BnscKtZKanpp6ybrjEp56toF2qu6Wx0WZpZqCfqr%2B0</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
