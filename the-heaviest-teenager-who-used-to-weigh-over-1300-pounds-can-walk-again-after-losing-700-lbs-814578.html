One of the most serious cases we’ve heard belongs to a young man named Khalid Mohsen Shaari, who still holds the record for the world’s heaviest teen. And his story proves that determination can completely change you and your path in life.
Khalid used to weigh a whooping 1,345 pounds.
The young man, who was born in 1991, had been leading a very reclusive lifestyle, since he couldn’t even leave his house due to his weight."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He&nbsp;hadn’t left his home for over <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2,5 years</a> and his case could have ended a&nbsp;lot differently if&nbsp;he&nbsp;hadn’t received the help he&nbsp;needed. It&nbsp;was in&nbsp;August 2013 when he&nbsp;was weighed and found to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the heaviest teen and <strong>2nd heaviest person in&nbsp;the entire world.</strong> His BMI was 204, and he&nbsp;couldn’t even get out of&nbsp;bed anymore.</p><p><h2>It&nbsp;was King Abdullah that ordered Khalid’s assistance.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bac/35b/e77f2857ecb34a253a92585b79.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2013, Saudi Arabia’s King <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>decided</a> to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something about the young man’s case and ordered his transfer to&nbsp;the <a href=# title=hospital data-link=tag>hospital</a>. But of&nbsp;course, Khalid was too big and heavy to&nbsp;be&nbsp;carried by&nbsp;hand out of&nbsp;his apartment. <strong>A&nbsp;special forklift was used for his removal</strong> and 30&nbsp;medical and civil defense staff members assisted in&nbsp;the efforts. They even had to&nbsp;partially demolish the walls of&nbsp;the house, so&nbsp;the entire bed could be&nbsp;carried out of&nbsp;the home with Khalid on&nbsp;it.</p><p>Khalid was taken to&nbsp;King Fahd Medical City in&nbsp;Riyadh in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through certain <a href=#>dietary restrictions</a> and physical activity programs. He&nbsp;didn’t have any kind of&nbsp;<a href=# title=surgery data-link=tag>surgery</a>, but instead followed his <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>diet</a> and managed to&nbsp;<strong>lose more than half his body weight (710&nbsp;lbs) in&nbsp;just 6&nbsp;months</strong>. He&nbsp;was moving around in&nbsp;a&nbsp;specially-made wheelchair until he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;walk by&nbsp;himself. In&nbsp;2014, the young man had improved his heart and lung functions and the inflammation in&nbsp;his body had been reduced a&nbsp;lot.</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;can now walk again.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/a17/cf1/1c97ff5cf5aa2671168c0a86b3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2016, a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>video</a> was posted that showed <strong>Khalid walking by&nbsp;himself using a&nbsp;Zimmer frame</strong>, showing how big of&nbsp;a&nbsp;progress he&nbsp;had made. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;side note, the young adult also had two siblings that were also obese, but were able to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;their own. Khalid’s case was only one of&nbsp;the many that the Saudi Ministry of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Health data-link=tag>Health</a> had been called to&nbsp;assist&nbsp;in. They had also helped two siblings that weighed 661 pounds and 771 pounds respectively <a href=#>lose the excess weight</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/747/ff5/08508953b186c9c7645c2c7004.jpg><p>Two years later, in&nbsp;2018, a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the man was released where he&nbsp;is&nbsp;completely unrecognizable.
