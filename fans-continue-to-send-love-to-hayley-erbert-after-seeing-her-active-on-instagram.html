Amid the challenging time, fans are wishing for her speedy recovery. Luckily, fans aren’t completely in the dark in relation to Erbert’s recovery, due to her husband, Derek Hough.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-notice-hayley-erbert-s-instagram-is-active>Fans Notice Hayley Erbert’s Instagram is Active</h2><p>Hayley Erbert reportedly began feeling frail towards the end of their tour in Washington, D.C. and was immediately hospitalized for an emergency surgery. Following the procedure, the DWTS judge announced her wife’s alarming condition on Instagram on December 7. At the time, he details that Erbert is now in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“stable condition.</a>“</p><p>Although Hough had already stated that Erbert is in stable condition, fans wanted to hear more about her. At this time, the professional dancer hasn’t given any updates on her recovery. Nonetheless, eagle eyed DWTS fans noticed that Erbert appeared to be active on Instagram. Fans noticed this because Erbert’s account liked a Reel shared by former DWTS pro Witney Carson.</p><p>On December 13, Carson shared an adorable clip of her two-year-old son Leo making a wish list for Santa. Jenna Johnson, Sharna Burgess, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Carrie Ann Inaba</a> are among the people from the DWTS family that liked the post. Fans also noticed that Erbert interacted with the post, taking it as a sign that she’s doing okay.</p><p>Soon after fans knew of Erbert’s condition, many have sent prayers, love, and support for the couple. Others went to Erbert’s latest post on Instagram to send their messages of encouragement.</p><p>“I know Derek is going to take wonderful care of you. All my thoughts and prayers are with you,” one fan wrote.</p><p>“Get better we need you strong,” another person commented.</p><p>In an additional Instagram update, Hough stated that Erbert is the long road to recovery. He also expressed his appreciation for the concern they’ve been receiving since the unfortunate time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-derek-hough-reflects-on-the-life-threatening-challenge>Derek Hough Reflects on the “Life-Threatening” Challenge</h2><p>In a recent Instagram post, Hough took the time to give some updates regarding his wife’s recovery process. The DWTS judge said Erbert is “doing well although she still has a way to go.”</p><p>“As you all know, the past week has been a challenging journey for us due to a life-threatening event that suddenly came into our lives. It was a time filled with uncertainty and fear, going from living our dreams onstage, to a nightmare in an instant,” he wrote.</p><p>In the next few weeks, Erbert will undergo another surgery to place a skull implant. This will “replace the piece [of the skull] that was removed during the craniectomy.” The surgery will also “restore the skull to its natural shape and protect the brain from injury.”</p><p>In the post, Hough also thanked followers for their support.</p><p>“Thank you for the incredible support and medical care she has received,” he wrote. “It’s been a profound reminder of how fragile life can be and how quickly things can change. But, it has also shown us the incredible strength and resilience that lies within us and the power of having a supportive community around us.”</p><p>According to Hough, they didn’t envision their holiday season to happen the way it did, but they’re still grateful to celebrate the same. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">married couple</a> is looking forward “to cherishing these moments with a deeper appreciation for life and the people in it.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Original_AlanRitchson_JimmyKimmel_DisneyRandy-Holmes-220x147.jpeg alt="Alan Ritchson Accuses ‘American Idol’ of Fabricating Fake Stories About Him" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xZqlrGWTpLu1tc2unGasn2LAprrDZqOorpViwbB5x5qwpZ2pYrKzrsSrq2aZlqmys3nSnpyippditaa%2BjJqaraGmmnqwuoyipayskZy%2FormO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
