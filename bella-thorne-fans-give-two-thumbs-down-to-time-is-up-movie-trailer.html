With this film hitting <a href=#>American theaters in early September</a>, it’s no surprise that this trailer is now out. This trailer features Thorne and Mascolo in the lead roles. While they’re so cute together that it’s painful, fans seem to be unimpressed by the trailer so far.</strong></p><p>Thorne is returning to the big screen with her new <a href=#>indie film, Time Is Up</a>. She plays Viven, a highly accomplished high school senior. Viven has a passion for physics and hopes to get into a prestigious American University. Alongside Thorne is fiancé, Italian singer Mascolo. He plays Royan, a troubled young man who is haunted by his past. These two characters are <a href=#>said to have</a> starkly different personalities. An accident forces the two characters to reclaim their lives.</p><p>Within the trailer, Thorne is heard talking about bonds between particles. She shows off how much her character thinks of life as a physics equation. This film teaser tells the narrative that Viven will wake up from the accident and not remember who she was with the night it happened. Eventually, the viewer sees her tell the person she thought she was with that she wasn’t. Interesting to see the whole plot line erupt in the trailer, but there’s got to be more to the story.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-aren-t-thrilled-with-time-is-up>Fans Aren’t Thrilled With ‘Time is Up’</h2><p>Fans have already been quite vocal about what made them unhappy about the new release. While some fans mentioned the film looks good, others were quick to share their thumbs down review. In the trailer, Thorne’s voiceover talks purely about the law of attraction. While we know this is because her character is absolutely obsessed with physics, others may not.</p><p>“Bro whatever analogy or whatever she was making made no sense,” said one fan on YouTube.</p><p>Another stated: “I was completely confused throughout the trailer. Looks like a terrible film.”</p><p>It turns out that fans aren’t thrilled for Thorne’s collaboration with her Italian fiancé. If I’m being honest, I can’t really figure out why they’re so upset about this. Thorne said that she was excited for this film because it was <a href=# class=broken_link>the first time she got to be on screen</a> with someone she actually loves. Can’t her fans just let her be happy?</p><p>“Good way to write off a holiday with your boyfriend though. The movie looks like something plastics would enjoy,” said a fan on YouTube.</p><p>Although the trailer doesn’t look amazing, I wouldn’t say it looks terrible. People have to remember that this is an independent made film. I think all of this fan dissatisfaction is a result of Thorne doing bigger films with higher production value in the past. Perhaps fans want her to remain in her Disney past.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Matt-WinkelmeyerGetty-Images.jpg alt="Terry Crews Has Entered the Chat: “If You Ain’t Been Sweating, You Don’t Need A Shower”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>bella thorne</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>new movie</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wZ6jpZldqbWwvs2eZJ%2BZnqh6qLXVnmStr59iwanBzJuqZpyfrLtuwM5mq6KllWK2tHnUqWSmp6aesm7A0ZqgpZ2iZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
