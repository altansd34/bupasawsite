The changes were driven mainly by a loss of enthusiasm among the president's independent and Republican supporters: Strong approval for Trump was down 2 points among GOP voters, to 45 percent, and 1 point among independents, to 13 percent.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">At the state level, some of the biggest negative swings in net approval came from places that backed Trump in the 2016 presidential election: Iowa (minus 9 percentage points), Idaho and Tennessee (minus 6 points), and Montana and Oklahoma (minus 5 points). On the positive side, Trump made a 6 point gain in New Hampshire and improved his standing in West Virginia and Vermont by 4 points.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Along with Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who are seeking re-election in November, other Senate Democrats defending seats in Trump-won states also saw mixed results in terms of the president’s approval ratings. In Ohio, Trump dipped into the red, posting a 5 point loss in net approval since February, while falling 3 points deeper into the hole in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- to minus 8 points and minus 12 points, respectively -- and dropping the same amount in Michigan, to minus 13. In West Virginia, Trump sports a 26 point net approval rating, and in North Dakota he improved to 10 points above water.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">March was also a mixed bag for Republicans, who are trying to retain Senate seats and improve on their 51-49 majority in the chamber. While Trump's approval fell into the red after a 4 point drop in Arizona, where there's an open-seat race to replace retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R), Trump has pulled to within 6 points of breaking even in neighboring Nevada, where Sen. Dean Heller (R) seeks re-election this fall.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6m%2FtrnPrGSmp56pta3FjJqnqaqfq66tedGaq6Kml2K1qsDSZqmem5%2BnsW64zrBkoqZdoq6zr8c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
