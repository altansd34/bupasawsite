But one major chain will soon bring its version of the salty snack to grocery stores and delivery services.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc., which owns and operates about 600 movie theaters in the United States, recently announced plans to start selling prepackaged and microwaveable popcorn <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>in supermarkets and malls</a> starting next year. New Morning Consult data indicates that consumer interest in theater-branded popcorn — and in the AMC brand itself — could make this a successful attempt to diversify revenue in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. But the company will have ground to make up compared to established, at-home popcorn brands.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>What the numbers say</strong></h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Nearly half of consumers (45 percent) said they “almost always” eat popcorn at movie theaters, while another 26 percent said they sometimes do. Meanwhile, 20 percent said they “almost always” eat popcorn when watching a movie or TV show at home.</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Though AMC said they will offer its popcorn at some mall kiosks, most Americans don’t consider popcorn to be much of a mall snack. Fifty-nine percent said they never eat popcorn at the mall.</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m"><strong>The impact</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">AMC’s upcoming popcorn side business is seen as a way for the embattled theater chain to make some extra cash without having to rely on the increasingly fickle theatrical business. While the data indicates that this expansion into popcorn sales would likely garner some consumer interest, it also shows that consumers’ loyalty to established supermarket brands could prove to be a challenge for AMC.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">If other chains follow AMC’s route, they likely face an even tougher battle on store shelves: Two-thirds of Americans said they are interested in AMC, the largest share among a list of a dozen popular theater chains and 11 points higher than interest in Cineworld Group PLC’s Regal Cinemas, which finished second. If any theater brand can push into the popcorn business, it’s AMC.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">The <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>survey</a> was conducted Nov. 12-14, 2021, among 2,200 U.S. adults, with a margin of error of 2 percentage points.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5a6pHnMqK2inV2ptaat056pZqifpbCwvs0%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
