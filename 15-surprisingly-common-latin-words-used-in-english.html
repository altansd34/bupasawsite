Ad hoc</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Done or created when needed or necessary</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>The word ad hoc<strong> </strong>comes from the Latin words ad (“to/for”) and hoc (“this”), which translates to “for this” or “for this situation.”</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> If we find that we don’t have enough employees to finish the project on time, we can hire more on an ad-hoc basis.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Agenda>2. Agenda</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> A list or plan of items to be discussed or accomplished, usually in a meeting</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>This word comes from the Latinlatin word agenda, meaning “things to be done.” Its plural form in Latin is agendum.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>I wanted to discuss the traffic problem at our city council meeting, but it wasn’t on the agenda. I’ll have to wait until the next meeting.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Alibi>3. Alibi</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>A piece of evidence showing you were somewhere else when a crime was committed</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>Coming from the Latin alibi, this word means “elsewhere.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>The judge couldn’t accuse the woman of robbery, as she had a great alibi: She was on vacation in Mexico when the crime was committed.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Altruism>4. Altruism&nbsp;</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Caring about others and selflessly doing things to help them</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>Altruism comes from the Latin word alter, meaning “other.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Altruism is very important to me. I want to make the world a better place by helping others.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Bona-fide>5. Bona fide</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Genuine; sincere</p><p><strong>Latin roots:</strong> Bona fide comes from the Latin word of the same spelling, meaning “in good faith” (with no fraud or deceit). The opposite of bona fide in Latin is mala fide (“in bad faith”).</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> My neighbor has a bona fide piece of jewelry from Ancient Egypt—he showed me the certificate of authenticity!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Carpe-diem>6. Carpe diem</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>Most commonly translated as “Seize the day,” this expression is used to encourage a person to make the most of the present day and not to wait for the future.</p><p><strong>Latin roots:</strong> The Latin term carpe diem literally translates to “Pluck the day.” Carpe means “pluck” and diem is “day.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>I really shouldn’t spend so much money on one night out, but oh well—carpe diem!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Ergo>7. Ergo</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Therefore</p><p><strong>Latin origins: </strong>Ergo as we know it is derived from the same word in Latin, which means “therefore.” It’s possible that ergo stems from the Latin word regere (“to guide or direct”). It’s also thought to be a possible contraction of *e rogo, or “in the direction of.”</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> I worked out at the gym for two hours this morning; ergo, I deserve that piece of cake!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Et-cetera>8. Et cetera</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> And other similar things; <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">abbreviated to “etc.”</a></p><p><strong>Latin roots:</strong> This one is a combination of two Latin words: et, meaning “and,” plus cetera, or “the rest.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>When you go camping, you need a sleeping bag, tent, camp stove, et cetera.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Facsimile>9. Facsimile</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>An identical copy; abbreviated to “fax”</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>Facsimile comes from two words: fac (the imperative form of facere) which means “make,” and simile, which is “like” or “similar.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>You don’t need to provide the original copy of your birth certificate, but you should send us a facsimile for our records.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Impromptu>10. Impromptu</h2><p><strong>Latin roots</strong>: English actually borrowed the word impromptu from French. However, the French got it from the Latin words in promptu, meaning “in readiness.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>We had a big problem with a client today, so we had an impromptu meeting to figure out what we should do.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=11.-Mundane>11. Mundane</h2><p><strong>What it means:</strong> Dull; ordinary</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>Mundane is derived from the Latin word mundus, meaning “world.” This translates to “of the world,” as in not heavenly.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>After being on vacation in Hawaii for two weeks, it’ll be hard to go back to our mundane lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=12.-Obvious>12. Obvious</h2><p><strong>What it means</strong>: Clear; easily noticed or understood</p><p><strong>Latin roots:</strong> Obvious, as we use it in English, is derived from the Latin obvius, which, itself, comes from obviam, meaning “in the way.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>It’s obvious that you like him; you won’t stop talking about him!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=13.-Per-diem>13. Per diem</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>An allowance given each day</p><p><strong>Latin roots: </strong>Per diem is a combination of two Latin words: per, which means “through,” “during,” or “by means of,” and diem (“day”).</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: When I go on business trips, my company gives me a per diem of $100 for my meals.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=14.-Per-se>14. Per se</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>By himself, herself or itself; essentially</p><p><strong>Latin roots:</strong> This expression is taken directly from the Latin per se, meaning “by itself,” “it itself” or “of itself.”</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Potato chips aren’t bad for you, per se; it’s when you eat too many of them that they become unhealthy.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=15.-Vice-versa>15. Vice versa</h2><p><strong>What it means: </strong>Indicates that the reverse of what you’ve just said is also true</p><p><strong>Latin origins: </strong>This word stems from vicis (“change” or “alternate order”) and versus (“to turn”).</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>When I need my sister, she’s there for me, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Look into Latin words used in everyday English</h2><p>As you might be starting to realize after reading the words listed above, Latin has a very strong influence on the English language—in fact, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">about two-thirds of English words</a> are borrowed from the ancient language. To understand English better, from the structure of words to their meanings, look into Latin!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Start your journey to reach fluency</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andrea-1.jpg><h2>Andrea Byaruhanga</h2><p>Andrea is a Canadian freelance writer and editor specializing in English, e-learning, EdTech, and SaaS.
