The NHL is still looking for a resolution to its Pride Night issue, but, for now, fans have made one thing clear to the league: They support it and its teams’ hosting LGBTQ+-themed games, according to a new Morning Consult survey. 
During the 2022-2023 regular season, players like the Philadelphia Flyers’ Ivan Provorov, San Jose Sharks’ James Reimer and Florida Panthers’ Eric and Marc Staal boycotted wearing their respective teams’ special warmup jerseys on Pride Night, a themed game aimed at raising the visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ+ community."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>
