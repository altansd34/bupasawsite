1. Tom Cruise was offered the lead role, but he turned it down.
Many famous actors were considered for the role of Rick O’Connell, including Tom Cruise, but the actor turned it down and Brendan Fraser was cast instead."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Tom Cruise was offered the lead role, but he&nbsp;turned it&nbsp;down.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/89e/f4d/1a7a20547486ce2b8980d098d4.jpg><p>Many famous actors were considered for the role of&nbsp;Rick O’Connell, including <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Tom Cruise</a>, but the actor turned it&nbsp;down and Brendan Fraser was cast instead. Cruise had almost 2&nbsp;decades to&nbsp;change his mind, and he&nbsp;eventually went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;the 2017 reboot of&nbsp;<i>The Mummy.</i></p><p><h2>2. The actor who played Imhotep had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;fully shaved twice a&nbsp;day during filming.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ff1/2d9/8c23b55c02836f89dbed68417c.jpg><p>Arnold Vosloo’s character required his whole body to&nbsp;be&nbsp;completely hairless while shooting. And even though they first tried waxing, Vosloo didn’t want to&nbsp;repeat the painful experience, so&nbsp;staff members opted for <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>shaving</a> his body twice a&nbsp;day instead.</p><p><h2>3. Rachel Weisz’s character was named after a&nbsp;real person.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/228/7a5/1eda8d50a7ab0c6036682920fd.jpg><p>The character of&nbsp;Evelyn Carnahan was inspired by&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Evelyn Herbert</a>, who was the daughter of&nbsp;British Egyptologist George Herbert, 5th Earl of&nbsp;Carnarvon. In&nbsp;1922, the real-life Evelyn and her father were the first 2&nbsp;people in&nbsp;modern times to&nbsp;enter Tutankhamun’s tomb.</p><p><h2>4. The movies were actually filmed in&nbsp;Morocco, not Egypt.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/887/87c/98cc7352e6ac3e2c5da2434387.jpg><p>Although the action of&nbsp;the first 2&nbsp;movies in&nbsp;the trilogy is&nbsp;set in&nbsp;Egypt, due to&nbsp;several issues, cast members couldn’t film there. Instead, they chose Morocco as&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>location</a>, and what we&nbsp;see as&nbsp;early twentieth-century Cairo in&nbsp;the movies is&nbsp;actually Marrakech.</p><p><h2>5. The actors on&nbsp;set had to&nbsp;drink a&nbsp;special brew every few hours.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/745/72e/e3b3a75b899dfadc6a42e3067b.jpg><p>Because they were shooting in&nbsp;the desert, the actors faced several real-life dangers, including dehydration. To&nbsp;prevent this, the medical team on&nbsp;set came up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>special concoction</a> that the actors had to&nbsp;drink every few hours.</p><p><h2>6. Rachel Weisz and Patricia Velasquez spent several months training just for one scene.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/044/2d3/afbcf7594eb486606da6ed1e8a.jpg><p>Although stunt doubles could have easily been used for the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>fight scene</a> in&nbsp;<i>The Mummy Returns</i>, both actresses decided to&nbsp;avoid this. Instead, they trained for 3&nbsp;months for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;8&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day to&nbsp;get in&nbsp;shape and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;shoot the scene themselves.</p><p><h2>7. Real rats and insects were used for some of&nbsp;the scenes.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f89/908/b5482e57098e28ca2ecd0da133.jpg><p>The horror we&nbsp;see on&nbsp;Weisz’s face when she’s tied up&nbsp;and has <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rats</a> crawl over here is&nbsp;genuine. Real rats were used for the scene, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;other <a href=# title=insects data-link=tag>insects</a> and vermin. The actor who played Dr. Chamberlain also had actual locusts crawl all over his neck and face.</p><p><h2>8. The set was built inside of&nbsp;a&nbsp;volcano.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fba/159/60abe555b8b8510ed58240f6c9.jpg><p>The set for the lost city of&nbsp;Hamunaptra was erected inside of&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>volcano</a> in&nbsp;southeast Morocco. Obviously, the <a href=# title=volcano data-link=tag>volcano</a> was a&nbsp;dormant one, and it&nbsp;even had an&nbsp;old fort already built inside&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>9. The scene in&nbsp;the library was filmed in&nbsp;just one take.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f4/318/30d7335c16b51bfff6cb92e110.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the first scenes of&nbsp;the movie, Weisz’s character is&nbsp;putting away books in&nbsp;the library. But the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>clumsy librarian</a> causes most of&nbsp;the books to&nbsp;come tumbling down. Putting them all back on&nbsp;the shelves would’ve taken many hours, but thanks to&nbsp;Weisz’s great acting, the scene was filmed in&nbsp;just one single take.</p><p><h2>10. The Medjai were originally supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;tattooed head to&nbsp;toe.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fff/119/16b0605446bb2f820a4bf1aec7.jpg><p>Director Stephen Sommers changed his mind because he&nbsp;thought actor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oded Fehr </a>was too handsome to&nbsp;be&nbsp;covered in&nbsp;so&nbsp;many tattoos.</p><p><h2>11. The actor who played Beni wasn’t very well-liked by&nbsp;the camels.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/502/670/f75bae5961861bc5992e42d2b7.jpg><p>Beni, played by&nbsp;Kevin J. O’Connor, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very unlikable character in&nbsp;the movie, and even the camels seemed to&nbsp;agree. During the scene where he&nbsp;loads up&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>camels</a>, the animals refuse to&nbsp;move. This, however, wasn’t scripted, but it&nbsp;seems the camels decided to&nbsp;add their own touch to&nbsp;the film.</p><p><h2>12. Brendan Fraser almost died while filming the scene in&nbsp;the gallows.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fe1/ad1/e6015d5c918f3df214fa2231d5.jpg><p>In&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>scenes</a>, Rick O’Connell is&nbsp;imprisoned and taken to&nbsp;the gallows to&nbsp;be&nbsp;hanged, while Evelyn tries to&nbsp;negotiate his release and ends up&nbsp;saving his life. Although a&nbsp;stunt double was used for the body shots, Fraser still had to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;rope placed around his neck for close-ups. During the second take, the rope was tightened to&nbsp;make Fraser’s acting more realistic, but the actor actually ended up&nbsp;passing out and had to&nbsp;be&nbsp;revived by&nbsp;the EMTs on&nbsp;set.</p><p>What’s your favorite movie from <i>The Mummy</i> franchise?
