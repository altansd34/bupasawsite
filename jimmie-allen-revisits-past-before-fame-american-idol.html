Following the series, he connected with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scotty McCreery</a> and toured after the release of Allen’s debut album, Mercury Lane.</p><p>“Scotty McCreery won that year so I’m still friends with him, Lauren Alaina,” he said. “Scotty, after I met him, he got a record deal. I got a record deal like seven years later but he was the first artist to take me on tour.”</p><p>Several years after the tour, Allen won both New Artist of the Year at the Country Music Association Awards and New Male Artist of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards. Now, Allen is practically a household name given his exposure on Dancing With the Stars season 30.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-juggled-multiple-jobs-before>He Juggled Multiple Jobs Before</h2><p>The country singer has been accustomed to struggles, especially during his younger years. When he moved to Nashville, Tennessee in 2007, he only had $21 in his bank account. This amount did not get far, so Allen had to spend sparingly. Apparently, he lived out of his car for months.</p><p>Detailing his life before American Idol, he said that he applied for several jobs to sustain himself.</p><p>“I lived in my car for a couple months and then just working jobs you know,” he said. “Overnight stock at Walmart, server, I was collecting trash, some waste management, a janitor at the middle school… You name it, I did it.”</p><p>“Support the dream until the dream supports you” has been Allen’s mantra. Allen borrowed this motto from someone and decided to apply the same not only in his career pursuit but also in his parenting.</p><p>“As a parent, chase your dreams. Never stop, but your child shouldn’t have to sacrifice what they need and what they want in order for you to be successful,” he said.</p><p>Today, Allen has been doing excellently in the country music scene. Last June, he released his latest album, Tulip Drive. Currently, he is preparing to become a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">professional bowler</a> in the sports league. Allen is set to appear as a mentor in the upcoming Battle Rounds on The Voice season 22.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-1403408141-1.jpg alt="‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ Producer Is Releasing a Tell-All Book About the Show" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57yaKkpqGVYq6tuMSnZKudpp7AqsDSZqeaq6Rir6ayzqucZp6RorJurcyeqaKbkaN6qrDOpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
