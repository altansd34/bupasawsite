There is&nbsp;even a&nbsp;special term created for this type of&nbsp;relationship, the May—December romance. It&nbsp;sounds pretty romantic, but some people still look down on&nbsp;couples whose age differs significantly. This happens because they don’t realize that there are amazing reasons why <a href=#>women</a> are attracted to&nbsp;silver foxes.</p><p>Now<strong> Bright Side</strong> knows at&nbsp;least 10&nbsp;valuable reasons why this happens. And we&nbsp;are going to&nbsp;tell you about them right now.</p><p><h2>10. They are more mature.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/494/132/d6d01250b986e5de24e238d3a5.jpg><p>It’s common knowledge that women tend to&nbsp;mature earlier than men. That’s why younger guys who are usually at&nbsp;the age where they still want to&nbsp;try different things and explore the world before entering a&nbsp;serious relationship, are just not the right partners for them.</p><p>Older men may <a href=#>seem</a> more reliable and attractive to&nbsp;women who are ready for deeper commitments and family. Because <strong>these men are more likely to&nbsp;have passed their wild phase and want to&nbsp;settle down</strong>.</p><p><h2>9. They know stuff.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/66e/fa5/7df5e15bd5be56c7e330fa059f.jpg><p>We’ve all heard that with age comes great wisdom. But there is&nbsp;also an&nbsp;ending to&nbsp;this saying: “But sometimes age comes alone.” It&nbsp;seems that <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oscar Wilde</a> was wrong, as&nbsp;studies <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>prove</a> that older men are more intelligent than younger men. And the possible reason is&nbsp;their broader life experience.</p><p>Women <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confirm</a> this finding. They are sure that <strong>older men have gone through plenty of&nbsp;life experience that has effectively taught them various lessons</strong>. You can see this through their conversations.</p><p><h2>8. They know what they want.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/87a/574/3d11ad5ebb9965b67c10c142d4.jpg><p>Another valuable trait some women <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>highlight</a> is&nbsp;that <strong>older men have less mess in&nbsp;their lives&nbsp;— and this means stability</strong>. They know exactly what they want, how to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it, and how meaningful it&nbsp;is. That’s why they usually don’t waste anyone’s time playing games. Plus, they likely have no&nbsp;barriers when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;approaching anyone whose help or&nbsp;advice they need.</p><p><h2>7. They are more financially stable.</h2></p><p>Most of&nbsp;women really want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;<a href=#>financially secure</a>. Because when you start a&nbsp;family, you need to&nbsp;make sure that your man has enough money and assets to&nbsp;provide the support you and your kids need. And this is&nbsp;where older men are usually ahead of&nbsp;the game.</p><p>An&nbsp;average Joe in&nbsp;his late 20s tends to&nbsp;have fewer assets and less savings compared to&nbsp;older men. Younger guys still have to&nbsp;develop themselves and their careers. <strong>They’re looking for financial opportunities, and family is&nbsp;not something they care about in&nbsp;the first place.</strong></p><p><h2>6. They are partners.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dab/d2a/2a275d52b8aa3676cf92706772.jpg><p><strong>Mature love is&nbsp;about patience, care, trust, and sometimes independence</strong> rather than anything else. But youth is&nbsp;known by&nbsp;its “all-or-nothing” mindset, storms of&nbsp;feelings, and standing ground. If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;at&nbsp;least one person who is&nbsp;wisely ready to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;back seat or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least to&nbsp;initiate the discussion of&nbsp;issues, there is&nbsp;hope for the relationship to&nbsp;last.</p><p>That’s why women <a href=#>appreciate</a> when their men are able to&nbsp;be&nbsp;partners and not someone who wants to&nbsp;make the world revolve around him. Women do&nbsp;not need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;told what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;or&nbsp;even “allowed” to&nbsp;do&nbsp;something. Being equal is&nbsp;the thing that actually matters.</p><p><h2>5. They have no&nbsp;problem with helping women around the house.</h2></p><p>Women <strong>do&nbsp;need help with household chores, and it&nbsp;seems that older men have fewer biases when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;this point</strong>. We&nbsp;can see this in&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;comments from women on&nbsp;Reddit, as&nbsp;they say their older significant others never claimed that household chores were only a&nbsp;woman’s job. For <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>example</a>, some men do&nbsp;the dishes after meals or&nbsp;even wash their own clothes.</p><p><h2>4. They know how to&nbsp;treat women.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/789/a1a/f888885808909436771361d6a5.jpg><p>It&nbsp;seems that women <a href=#>appreciate</a> all the relationship experience older men might have had. And it&nbsp;is&nbsp;no&nbsp;wonder since they really have had enough time to&nbsp;develop and practice their skills for treating women right.</p><p>The <strong>knowledge of&nbsp;what makes love fail or&nbsp;go&nbsp;on&nbsp;gives them a&nbsp;bit of&nbsp;advantage.</strong> They understand what women usually need and what will make them happy. They know how to&nbsp;avoid (or&nbsp;at&nbsp;least try to&nbsp;avoid) the same problems they have already been through. And this makes the relationship that much easier.</p><p><h2>3. They’re charismatic.</h2></p><p><strong>Older men have a&nbsp;unique attractiveness that triggers something in&nbsp;women. </strong>First of&nbsp;all, it’s in&nbsp;their appearance&nbsp;— noble wrinkles around their eyes, salt and pepper hair, light stubble in&nbsp;some of&nbsp;them. They also have their own way of&nbsp;presenting themselves, and women like the way they act, laugh, and behave. They stand out thanks to&nbsp;their unique sense of&nbsp;style <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>because</a> they don’t usually follow fashion trends as&nbsp;closely as&nbsp;college-aged boys.</p><p><h2>2. They don’t seek out drama.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ddd/b5e/ebf9dd55d3afc96d7bfb2d7cb5.jpg><p>Let’s face&nbsp;it, women can be&nbsp;pretty emotional creatures. Some can easily exaggerate things and act without thinking. That’s why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;important for them to&nbsp;have men who are able to&nbsp;make them stop and take a&nbsp;breath. And it&nbsp;appears that older men <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tend</a> to&nbsp;have this skill.</p><p>We&nbsp;believe that they just don’t look for any drama or&nbsp;conflict anymore. They prefer not to&nbsp;argue over ordinary problems. And even if&nbsp;<strong>there is&nbsp;an&nbsp;issue, they can sit down and talk it&nbsp;out like adults and come up&nbsp;with a&nbsp;solution that will be&nbsp;beneficial for all parties</strong>.</p><p><h2>1. They provide a&nbsp;feeling of&nbsp;security.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b08/125/39a8795d7f8ad078db42f9fd27.jpg><p>Some women <a href=#>mentioned</a> security in&nbsp;their comments, and we&nbsp;can’t omit this point either. In&nbsp;fact, security is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;our basic needs, according to&nbsp;<a href=#>Maslow’s hierarchy of&nbsp;needs</a>. And <strong>what can make women secure and comfortable in&nbsp;their everyday lives? We&nbsp;believe that all the things we’ve discussed above can do&nbsp;this</strong>.</p><p>You need money and other assets to&nbsp;be&nbsp;financially secure. You need a&nbsp;reliable partner to&nbsp;spend your life with. And you need to&nbsp;know where your life is&nbsp;going. It&nbsp;seems that older men are better able to&nbsp;provide all of&nbsp;these things and make&nbsp;us feel safe.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you find older men attractive?
