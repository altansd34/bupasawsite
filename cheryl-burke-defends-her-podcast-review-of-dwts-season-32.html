Burke emphasized that she won’t hold back in sharing her honest opinions about this season of Dancing with the Stars.</strong></p><p>Last week, Burke reacted to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 32 premiere</a> of Dancing with the Stars on an episode of her new podcast. She gave her honest opinions about each of the pairings this season, and they weren’t all positive.</p><p>For example, she shared that she would have liked to see Val Chmerkovskiy paired with “an actual woman,” rather than 17-year-old Xochitl Gomez. She suggested that Chmerkovskiy should have switched partners with Brandon Armstrong, who is dancing with Lele Pons this season.</p><p>Burke also expressed some doubt about new pro dancer Rylee Arnold, who is only 18. She questioned if Arnold has the competitive experience and teaching ability to do well with her partner Harry Jowsey. She also suggested that the judges should “stay in their lane” when it came to commenting on technique.</p><p>Apparently, not everyone was happy to hear Burke’s critical comments on the new season. The former pro dancer took to Instagram to clear the air and defend her right to share her opinion.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CHERYL BURKE SPILLS JUICY ‘DWTS’ SECRETS ON NEW PODCAST ‘SEX, LIES, AND SPRAY TANS’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-burke-defends-herself-on-instagram>Burke Defends Herself on Instagram</h2><p>Burke posted a video on Instagram, which she started by saying that she “received some shocking messages around my new podcast.” She went on to say that she wanted to “clear the air.”</p><p>“I deeply apologize to anyone taking offense to any of my comments on my podcast,” Burke said. “However, I just want everyone to know my intention is never to be mean. It’s my truth, and it’s my opinion. And I am so sorry if it hurt or affected anyone.”</p><p>She emphasized that her opinions are informed by years of experience as a pro dancer on DWTS, adding that she’s “never one to sugarcoat.” Burke said it’s her job to give her opinion, adding, “Whether people agree with me or not isn’t my business.”</p><p>The dancer ended her video by saying she wishes all of the contestants and pros “the best of luck” this season. She said she was “sending everyone so much love and light.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Original_MelB_Frazer-HarrisonGetty-Images-220x147.jpeg alt="Mel B Says Her Fiancé Makes Her Feel ‘More Confident Than Ever’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Cheryl Burke</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqGcq7GcYq%2B2vsqeZJ2dlpq7pb%2BMoZyrZaCksaSt0q1kq52mnrK4ec6fZJ2vpKh6tLHArKanZWNnfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
