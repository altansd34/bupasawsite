British astronomer Richard Carrington was observing the surface of&nbsp;the Sun through his telescope when he&nbsp;suddenly noticed something strange. There were two patches of&nbsp;very bright and white light. It’s 1859. People are outside, working on&nbsp;their farms, harvesting the fruits of&nbsp;their labor.</p><p>Life is&nbsp;different&nbsp;— more nature, less <a href=# title=technology data-link=tag>technology</a>. Science is&nbsp;developing, not even a&nbsp;lightbulb is&nbsp;invented yet&nbsp;— it&nbsp;will be&nbsp;invented in&nbsp;20&nbsp;years, though. Back then the astronomer didn’t know he&nbsp;was looking at&nbsp;what would later be&nbsp;called the Carrington Event, the largest solar storm ever recorded. In&nbsp;fact, this was the first solar flare we’ve ever seen and reported! And there was so&nbsp;much going&nbsp;on!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f4f/0a9/4d34915599a53208a14bc622b3.png><p>Auroras&nbsp;— the Southern and Northern lights&nbsp;— were just amazing. They have been more intense in&nbsp;that year than in&nbsp;the last 160 years from now. Auroras mostly appear near the Earth’s poles. But back then you could see these perfectly illuminated lights in&nbsp;the sky close to&nbsp;both the equator and the poles. They spread across the sky everywhere from Australia to&nbsp;Canada. If&nbsp;you happened to&nbsp;visit the tropics&nbsp;— like Panama, Jamaica, or&nbsp;Cuba&nbsp;— you could also see auroras.</p><p>It&nbsp;was spectacular&nbsp;— luminous waves were rolling up&nbsp;as&nbsp;far as&nbsp;the zenith and some were even big enough to&nbsp;cast a&nbsp;shadow on&nbsp;the ground. And the colorful displays were really bright! If&nbsp;you were in&nbsp;Missouri at&nbsp;that time, you could normally read a&nbsp;book by&nbsp;the atmospheric light even after midnight. The light was so&nbsp;strong that the gold miners that were in&nbsp;the Rocky Mountains just woke&nbsp;up, prepared their bacon and eggs, and made coffee without further questions.</p><p>They thought the sun had risen on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cloudy morning, even though it&nbsp;was 1&nbsp;a.m. local time. But... This extremely strong solar outburst resulted in&nbsp;electrical disruptions from Boston to&nbsp;<a href=# title=Paris data-link=tag>Paris</a> too. And, the telegraph lines! There was so&nbsp;much electricity in&nbsp;the air, telegraph machines could send messages from Pittsburgh to&nbsp;New York without batteries. In&nbsp;Paris, even sparks flew from telegraph machines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b5d/fd2/fdf16c5d7997bdd9c1581089e0.png><p>And now, fears are mounting that there’s another powerful solar storm coming in&nbsp;2025. It&nbsp;could cause massive power cuts and blackouts as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;cut off internet access in&nbsp;entire communities&nbsp;— maybe even for months or&nbsp;years. Today we&nbsp;depend on&nbsp;electricity way more than we&nbsp;did back then. Not only when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;gadgets in&nbsp;our homes, but hospitals and other places where technology is&nbsp;simply necessary.</p><p>Electricity is&nbsp;essential even for food, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;need electricity to&nbsp;store&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;need it&nbsp;for our everyday things like work and communication. Another solar storm as&nbsp;strong as&nbsp;the Carrington Event could cause trillions of&nbsp;dollars of&nbsp;damage here on&nbsp;Earth. It&nbsp;would knock out power for up&nbsp;to&nbsp;40&nbsp;million people only in&nbsp;the United States&nbsp;— for a&nbsp;few years.</p><p>What are solar flares anyway? They are the biggest explosive events that happen in&nbsp;our solar system. So, magnetic energy builds up&nbsp;the Sun. BAM! When there’s an&nbsp;intense burst of&nbsp;that magnetic energy, that’s when the solar outburst happens. This throws off whole waves of&nbsp;energy that move and travel outward. Of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;impacts other bodies in&nbsp;our solar system, including the Earth. And when these electromagnetic waves interact with the magnetic field of&nbsp;our home planet, a&nbsp;few things happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/798/4e2/8febb35e0a8c546ab2dde19704.png><p>First what we&nbsp;get is&nbsp;that electric currents flow in&nbsp;the upper layer of&nbsp;our atmosphere. They heat the air. It’s like the Earth gets its own electric blanket. This is&nbsp;the stage where you can see stunning auroras over polar regions. But it’s also when GPS and radio signals get disrupted. As&nbsp;our atmosphere heats, it&nbsp;puffs up&nbsp;similar to&nbsp;a&nbsp;marshmallow. This adds more drag to&nbsp;satellites in&nbsp;low orbit. It&nbsp;means that as&nbsp;the atmosphere expands it’s pushing satellites back down to&nbsp;the surface of&nbsp;our planet. It&nbsp;also knocks small pieces of&nbsp;space junk off their course.</p><p>As&nbsp;strong electric currents flow through the Earth’s upper atmosphere, they affect strong currents that flow through our planet’s crust too. This can mess with electrical conductors that sit on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;the crust, like power grids. They make the network that carries electricity from generating stations to&nbsp;buildings and homes. And this results in&nbsp;power outages in&nbsp;certain areas&nbsp;— and these can be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;fix.</p><p>For instance, this happened in&nbsp;Quebec in&nbsp;March 1989. A&nbsp;powerful solar flare burst off the Sun. Shortly after that, another burst sent out a&nbsp;billion tons of&nbsp;gas directly to&nbsp;our planet. People there experienced a&nbsp;12-hour blackout. Only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;months later, in&nbsp;August, another solar flare burst towards our planet. It&nbsp;was even bigger than the one that occurred in&nbsp;March. It&nbsp;caused damage to&nbsp;microchips across the world and left Quebec in&nbsp;darkness once again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/500/653/15af915a4295844e526a0c6c8c.png><p>Flares can be&nbsp;more dangerous for the technology we&nbsp;have than for ourselves. In&nbsp;winter 2022, a&nbsp;solar storm knocked a&nbsp;fleet of&nbsp;over 40&nbsp;Starlink mini-satellites out of&nbsp;orbit. Solar storms often happen at&nbsp;the same time when the Sun releases large bubbles of&nbsp;solar material we&nbsp;know as&nbsp;CMEs or&nbsp;coronal mass ejections. These bubbles can have billions of&nbsp;tons of&nbsp;plasma&nbsp;— which can move at&nbsp;millions of&nbsp;miles per hour.</p><p>That way, solar storms fire out radiation whereas CMEs are plasma eruptions. CMEs and solar flares discharge particles and radiation. As&nbsp;they hit the upper part of&nbsp;Earth’s atmosphere, they form radio waves. We&nbsp;call them geomagnetic storms. They form new currents and add energy into electrical grids that are usually passive. This way they threaten to&nbsp;overload them.</p><p>Take electricity that’s coming out of&nbsp;your wall plug as&nbsp;an&nbsp;example. It&nbsp;changes back and forth by&nbsp;about 50&nbsp;hertz, depending on&nbsp;the country you live&nbsp;in. Radio waves usually broadcast about 85-105 million hertz. Gamma rays and X-rays have frequencies of&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;50&nbsp;quintillion hertz. Solar radiation is&nbsp;the same one your phone uses for power, only a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;billion times stronger and kinda out of&nbsp;control.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/c28/47d/1a2aa453919ae2f3b1c3ba1b53.png><p>Researchers believe a&nbsp;powerful solar storm might hit&nbsp;us in&nbsp;2025. These storms get to&nbsp;their peak&nbsp;— which, by&nbsp;the way, can turn pretty violent&nbsp;— every 11&nbsp;years. We&nbsp;mostly get lucky because they bypass&nbsp;us. But we&nbsp;can’t expect our good fortune to&nbsp;last forever. Now we&nbsp;have about a&nbsp;2-3 percent chance for a&nbsp;Carrington-level event to&nbsp;happen in&nbsp;this decade. The shorted electric grid wouldn’t be&nbsp;only a&nbsp;one-time loss. It&nbsp;would take&nbsp;us up&nbsp;to&nbsp;10&nbsp;years to&nbsp;recover from something like that. That way, humankind might be&nbsp;set back by&nbsp;nearly 20&nbsp;years if&nbsp;it&nbsp;happens.</p><p>All those particles wildly bursting around could cause damage to&nbsp;our satellites. We&nbsp;could lose communications that way. No&nbsp;TV, internet, or&nbsp;GPS. We’d be&nbsp;dealing with very, very strong radiation. There’s a&nbsp;possibility people would face some long-term issues because of&nbsp;that. What could such an&nbsp;amount of&nbsp;solar radiation do&nbsp;to&nbsp;our DNA?</p><p>Especially to&nbsp;those that are not protected by&nbsp;the magnetic field of&nbsp;our planet, like astronauts. Humankind can try to&nbsp;protect the internet against the next enormous solar storm. The first thing we&nbsp;can do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;shore up&nbsp;power grids, undersea cables, and satellites against being overloaded. And we&nbsp;can look for methods of&nbsp;predicting such storms in&nbsp;the long term.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f13/860/87409a5f2ea4e98c497141c835.png><p>That’s hard because these storms have been happening for millions of&nbsp;years, and we’ve been able to&nbsp;record them for less than a&nbsp;century. Plus, the technology these storms affect is&nbsp;only two decades old. At&nbsp;the moment, we&nbsp;can observe the activity of&nbsp;sunspots, which are black patches on&nbsp;the solar surface that tell&nbsp;us it’s the area with high plasma activity.</p><p>And by&nbsp;checking them, we&nbsp;can predict solar storms up&nbsp;to&nbsp;two days before they strike our planet. But we&nbsp;can’t track them the way we&nbsp;follow hurricanes. Hopefully, we’ll be&nbsp;more ready by&nbsp;2025. To&nbsp;avoid an&nbsp;internet-less future... Although, it&nbsp;would be&nbsp;cool to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break from social media, don’t you think?</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK%2Bqs4yspqWZomLAtbvRpmScmZ5isaa%2F06umsmWZo8Gmvs2eq2ahnmJ%2FcX6UZm9qbWJnfXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
