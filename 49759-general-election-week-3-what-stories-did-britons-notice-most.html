Respondents answer in their own words, which our AI language model categorises, allowing us to capture which specific stories have cut through the most with the public.</p><p data-block-key=s884>With further sets of results now released, we take a look back over what stories made the most impact over the last week.</p><p data-block-key=bamgq>Politically, the biggest story of the last week for the public was Rishi Sunak’s ill-advised decision to leave D-Day commemorations early in order to film an election interview. In our poll on 7-8 June this was the biggest story for 11% of Britons – by the time of our next poll on 10-11 June this figure had increased to 26%. This figure remained consistent for the next couple of days, before finally dropping to 16% in our most recent poll on 13-14 July (although this still ranks second overall, behind only general news about the election, which 19% say is the story they’ve heard most about this week).</p><p data-block-key=4qqpb>Were it not for the disappearance and death of Dr Michael Mosley, the D-Day blunder figure might have peaked at a much higher level. On 10-11 June the loss of the celebrity doctor was the story that the largest number of Britons singled out as the one they had heard most about, at 30%, subsequently tying with the D-Day story the next day at 24% and still being cited by 20% the day after. As of our most recent poll, 11% are still saying it is the story they have heard the most about this last week, the third highest number.</p><p data-block-key=12auc>In terms of emerging stories, Rishi Sunak will be frustrated to hear that another negative news story about him has gained some traction – in our most recent poll, 9% of Britons say the story that they heard most about this last week was about how he had to “do without” Sky TV as a child.</p><p data-block-key=18gpa>Separately, following a week of manifesto launches, 7% of Britons say that coverage of the parties’ pledges is the news they have heard most about this week.</p><p data-block-key=8r533>You can read more about how our AI model works <a href=#>in our launch article</a>.
