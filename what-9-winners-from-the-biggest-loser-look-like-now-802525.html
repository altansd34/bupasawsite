Season 1&nbsp;winner Ryan Benson came to&nbsp;the set weighing 330&nbsp;pounds. Months of&nbsp;exhausting workouts and severe dietary restrictions allowed him to&nbsp;lose 122&nbsp;pounds. But as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;the show ended and Ryan returned home, he&nbsp;began to&nbsp;gain weight again.</p><p>Ryan got his second chance in&nbsp;2017 by&nbsp;agreeing to&nbsp;star in&nbsp;an&nbsp;episode of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#><i>The Big Fat Truth</i></a>. This program aimed to&nbsp;find out about the behavioral problems that lead participants to&nbsp;<a href=# title=obesity data-link=tag>obesity</a>. After participating in&nbsp;the program, Benson changed his <a href=# title=lifestyle data-link=tag>lifestyle</a> and his diet. He&nbsp;began to&nbsp;exercise and now he&nbsp;willingly <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>shares</a> his photos on&nbsp;Instagram.</p><p><h2>Ali Vincent, the first female winner of&nbsp;season 5&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/127/409/3aee585826bcad5c6052725583.jpg><p>When <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Alison “Ali” Vincent</a> came to&nbsp;the show, she weighed 234&nbsp;pounds.

For a&nbsp;long time, Ali managed to&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;shape, she even hosted her own&nbsp;TV show dedicated to&nbsp;a&nbsp;healthy lifestyle. However, in&nbsp;2015, tragic events <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>led</a> to&nbsp;the fact that her weight began to&nbsp;grow again and she reached 200&nbsp;pounds. Currently, Ali is&nbsp;a&nbsp;happy <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>mother</a> of&nbsp;twin boys, whom she gave birth to&nbsp;in&nbsp;2018. Who knows, she might get back to&nbsp;her weight loss journey one day.</p><p><h2>Helen Phillips, the oldest female winner of&nbsp;season 7&nbsp;of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1fc/492/83bc0a525e86c59c4cda9fb97b.jpg><p>The mother of&nbsp;3, 48-year-old Helen Phillips, came to&nbsp;the show with her eldest daughter Shanon. It&nbsp;was the second attempt of&nbsp;the producers to&nbsp;make a&nbsp;show for couples. Her starting weight was 257&nbsp;pounds. And <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>according</a> to&nbsp;Helen, she never dreamed of&nbsp;becoming a&nbsp;finalist, “Maybe I&nbsp;was going to&nbsp;lose 50&nbsp;pounds, maybe&nbsp;60, but here I&nbsp;am.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12a/ca6/a93ea750ec93806ad99b144394.jpg><p>After the show, Helen didn’t want to&nbsp;make her life public, but from time to&nbsp;time she gets attention from journalists. She still works out, takes care of&nbsp;her body, and <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>looks</a> great.</p><p><h2>Danny Cahill, season 8&nbsp;winner of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d1b/14f/28edcc5147829b02e7bb55c657.jpg><p>Danny’s weight loss <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>story</a> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tale of&nbsp;ups and downs. Danny was overweight from age 7&nbsp;to&nbsp;15. He&nbsp;knew that he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;ridiculed in&nbsp;high school so&nbsp;he&nbsp;worked hard and lost 75&nbsp;pounds. Danny became very popular and was the envy of&nbsp;all the guys. However, after high school, his weight steadily increased throughout the years. He&nbsp;came to&nbsp;the show with a&nbsp;weight of&nbsp;430 pounds and left it&nbsp;as&nbsp;the winner, dropping 239 of&nbsp;them.</p><p>Cahill founded a&nbsp;company to&nbsp;help and motivate other people, started blogging, and wrote several books about his weight loss, but over time the pounds began to&nbsp;return again. A&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>study</a> following Cahill, and other contestants from another show, found that he&nbsp;burned 800 calories a&nbsp;day less than other men his size because he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;slower <a href=# title=metabolism data-link=tag>metabolism</a>. By&nbsp;that time, Danny had regained about 100&nbsp;pounds.</p><p><h2>Daris George, season 9&nbsp;finalist of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/17c/def/992aa75de688f969eda87e6730.jpg><p>Daris became the finalist of&nbsp;the show but failed to&nbsp;take the 1st place, though he&nbsp;remained number 1&nbsp;in&nbsp;the hearts of&nbsp;the audience. The charming curly-haired young man <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>weighed</a> 346 pounds at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the season, and just 178 pounds at&nbsp;the end. He&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;take part in&nbsp;the show not just for the sake of&nbsp;his health but also because he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>wanted</a> to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;family.</p><p>Now the audience’s favorite is&nbsp;doing well: he&nbsp;got married and had children. And even though Daris regained some extra pounds, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>looks</a> happy and content with life.</p><p><h2>Olivia Ward, season 11&nbsp;winner of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i>. She’s one of&nbsp;the most successful graduates of&nbsp;the project.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b84/640/07285054829079101b4a5cc454.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>Olivia Ward</a> came to&nbsp;the show because she had dreamed of&nbsp;becoming an&nbsp;opera singer and believed that her weight (261&nbsp;pounds) was an&nbsp;obstacle in&nbsp;her profession. Olivia left the project at&nbsp;a&nbsp;weight of&nbsp;130 pounds and with completely different aspirations. She and her sister Hannah, who also took part in&nbsp;the show and reached the finale, started a&nbsp;fitness blog and opened their own YouTube channel.</p><p>After that Olivia became a&nbsp;trainer at&nbsp;the fitness company SoulCycle. In&nbsp;January 2020, she gave birth to&nbsp;her second son, quickly got back in&nbsp;shape, and started hosting motivational webinars.</p><p><h2>Dannielle Allen, season 14&nbsp;winner of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i></h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/684/de7/3c4dcb594190b82fd2635bf53e.jpg><p>Danni <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>dropped</a> 121 pounds during the show, reducing her weight from 258 to&nbsp;137&nbsp;pounds.

Rachel avoids publicity, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>maintains</a> a&nbsp;closed Instagram account, and doesn’t participate in&nbsp;shows dedicated to&nbsp;the former winners of&nbsp;the show.</p><p><h2>Jim DiBattista, the winner of&nbsp;the 2020 season of&nbsp;<i>The Biggest Loser</i></h2></p><p>After a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;critical speeches, as&nbsp;well as&nbsp;the publication of&nbsp;a&nbsp;long-term <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>study</a> of&nbsp;participants of&nbsp;the 11th season, which showed that the majority of&nbsp;them were unable to&nbsp;maintain a&nbsp;normal weight, the show was closed. In&nbsp;2020, it&nbsp;was released on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new channel in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>updated</a> format after a&nbsp;4-year hiatus.</p><p>The new approach didn’t affect the amazing results of&nbsp;the winner: he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;lose 144&nbsp;pounds, down from 385. After the show, Jim returned to&nbsp;his work as&nbsp;a&nbsp;children’s coach and continued to&nbsp;lose weight. In&nbsp;the summer of&nbsp;2020, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>reached</a> his target weight of&nbsp;160&nbsp;pounds. Fans <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>continue</a> to&nbsp;follow his further achievements on&nbsp;his Instagram.</p><p><h2>Bonus</h2></p><p>There are different types of&nbsp;weight-loss shows on&nbsp;television around the world now. One foreign show guides its participants throughout the entire year. Each episode is&nbsp;dedicated to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different participant or&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple. This <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>couple</a>, for example, entered the project with the total weight of&nbsp;both spouses adding up&nbsp;to&nbsp;600&nbsp;pounds. A&nbsp;year later, each of&nbsp;them lost 145&nbsp;pounds, and their total weight dropped to&nbsp;310&nbsp;pounds.</p><p>Do&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;favorite weight-loss show on&nbsp;TV?
