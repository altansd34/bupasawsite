Later, in&nbsp;March <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2017</a>, the lovely pair welcomed their first daughter, Lea De&nbsp;Seine Shayk Cooper.</p><p>Cooper and Shayk kept a&nbsp;low profile after her birth, keeping her out of&nbsp;the spotlight while still being snapped here and there, spending quality <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> time together. Despite their busy schedules, they both worked hard to&nbsp;raise their child on&nbsp;their own, refusing to&nbsp;hire a&nbsp;babysitter. Irina <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>claimed</a>, “When I’m with my&nbsp;daughter, I’m 100% a&nbsp;mother, and when she’s with her dad, he’s 100% her dad.”</p><p><h2>Their relationship may have ended, but they both take parenting very seriously.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b5/783/fb43f351499dc107513c3fe379.jpg><p>DDNY/Broadimage/Broad Image/East News</p><p>As&nbsp;Cooper was heavily immersed in&nbsp;his work, some reports mentioned that a&nbsp;crisis between the pair began to&nbsp;brew. “They want to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stay together</a> for their daughter, but neither of&nbsp;them is&nbsp;very happy.” However, Cooper and Shayk were officially done in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>2019</a>, but they were still doing their best for their kid.</p><p>While their paths as&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple diverged, Cooper was steadfast in&nbsp;his commitment to&nbsp;raising his daughter as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single parent and making every effort to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;loving father to&nbsp;her. He&nbsp;did so&nbsp;well, in&nbsp;fact, that Shayk praised him for being the outstanding parent he&nbsp;was. “He’s a&nbsp;full-on, hands-on dad,” the model <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ada/271/c213bb5f3b879c3d897c16aa8a.jpg><p>Cooper has repeatedly shown that being a&nbsp;father is&nbsp;the proudest achievement of&nbsp;his life.
