Animal fat or suet</h2><p class=align-left>On the Canadian <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">inspection website</a>, there are strict conditions before you can bring it. It said:</p>"Permitted only if accompanied into Canada by you (cannot be brought in by mail or courier).""Products cooked and shelf-stable (safe at room temperature) and products purchased in a sealed container (such as a glass jar, can, retort pouch, semi-rigid disposable serving dishes for ready-to-eat meals)."<h2>2. Baked snacks and biscuits</h2><p class=align-left>Canadian law allows you to bring pastries and biscuits. However, the condition is that they must not contain meat in them.</p><h2>3. Sweets and other confectionaries</h2><p class=align-left>Like those in point 2, the confectionaries must not contain meat. This may cover things like chocolate and other sweetened eatables.</p><h2>4. Non-alcoholic beverages</h2><p class=align-left>Beverages under this group are allowed. There are no restrictions on this at all. But it is important to always check with the Inspection page to see if anything has been updated.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d5f86b6419da663f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>67 incredibly creepy facts that will make your hair stand on end</span></p></a><h2>5. Spices, tea, coffee and oils</h2><p class=align-left>Food spices, tea and coffee are allowed. No wonder there have been videos of people taking things like ground pepper, ogbono, and okro among other spices.</p><h2>Always consult AIRS</h2><p class=align-left>Another thing worthy of note is that most of those food items are not expected to exceed 20kg in weight. In some cases, you need to consult <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Automated Import Reference System</a> (AIRS) for permission requirements. When in doubt, always refer to AIRS.</p><h2>Lady regretted on food items she took to Canada</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, <strong>Legit.ng</strong> earlier reported that a young Nigerian lady stirred massive reactions on TikTok after sharing a video showing what she <a href=#>regretted taking when relocating</a> to Canada.</p><p class=align-left>In the clip, she gave garri and palm oil as some of the food items. She even listed dry okra and cocoyam powder.</p><p class=align-left>Many Nigerians in her comment section were surprised that she would regret travelling with such when they are sought-after items among Africans abroad.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkvaa7z6WcaGllZoJygJNmp6unpp7AqrvNZqWin5WntqJ5wpqlmpyRYsGzrdWeo6Whnpx8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
