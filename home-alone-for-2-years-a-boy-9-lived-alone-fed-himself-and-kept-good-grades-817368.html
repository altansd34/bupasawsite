The maturity of&nbsp;a&nbsp;9-year-old, who was able to&nbsp;care for himself and even excel at&nbsp;<a href=# title=school data-link=tag>school</a>, is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real subject for admiration for&nbsp;us all.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;9-year-old survived alone for 2&nbsp;years.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c0/87a/ac13bc5e769a2289a8f323812b.jpg><p>A&nbsp;young French boy <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>survived</a> all by&nbsp;himself from when he&nbsp;was 9&nbsp;to&nbsp;when he&nbsp;turned&nbsp;11, and a&nbsp;single adult didn’t notice his terrible situation. According to&nbsp;the major news outlets, “nobody noticed anything,” even the staff at&nbsp;boy’s school, where the brave kid was known as&nbsp;a&nbsp;very good pupil.</p><p>The neighbors of&nbsp;the abandoned child <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>didn’t notice</a> that he&nbsp;had been left home alone, for a&nbsp;big period of&nbsp;time. They were sure that the boy’s mom was around him, even though they did bring him food sometimes.</p><p>In&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a href=# title=interview data-link=tag>interview</a>, a&nbsp;next-door neighbor <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “For&nbsp;me, it&nbsp;was normal, his mother was waiting for him at&nbsp;home. I&nbsp;had no&nbsp;idea that he&nbsp;was alone at&nbsp;home.” The news also reported that the lonesome boy mostly fed himself with cake and cold canned food.</p><p>The resilient child would also reportedly get <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>tomatoes</a> from the neighbor’s balcony. The boy would also spend a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>without</a> heat or&nbsp;electricity and slept under three duvets. Sometimes, he&nbsp;would even wash himself with cold water.</p><p><h2>The boy’s mother was living nearby all this time.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/119/77a/64bf9c59f08fed370d2af99b64.jpg><p>The boy’s mother <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lived</a> with her boyfriend a&nbsp;few kilometers away and would visit her child on&nbsp;occasion. She <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>used</a> her food stamps, given to&nbsp;her by&nbsp;their local social welfare agency, to&nbsp;buy her son cakes and biscuits from the grocers. But the woman, 39, never stayed the night.</p><p>The boy’s father was absent from the family, having separated from his mother when he&nbsp;was young. Even the phone data showed that the mother rarely visited the flat and didn’t accompany her son to&nbsp;and from school, which was a&nbsp;few kilometers away.</p><p>After the boy was taken into social services and placed in&nbsp;a&nbsp;foster home, his mom was granted visitation rights, but she has only seen her son twice. Her son, however, has no&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;seeing his mother anymore.</p><p><h2>People weren’t alarmed when it&nbsp;all started, because of&nbsp;how well the boy looked after himself.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c36/363/ad281f5d3085874d721dff7122.jpg><p>Despite his living conditions, the news reported that the boy still attended school and even received good grades.</p><p>The boy’s fellow students didn’t suspect anything either, thinking he&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;solitary child. As&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them said, “He&nbsp;told friends that he&nbsp;ate alone and took the bus alone. He&nbsp;didn’t go&nbsp;out, he&nbsp;stayed at&nbsp;home.”</p><p>Only after some time, worried neighbors called the police and the officials stepped&nbsp;in. “I&nbsp;met his mom in&nbsp;May 2022,” Mayor Barbara Couturier told in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a>. “She came to&nbsp;tell&nbsp;us that she had financial problems, and we&nbsp;gave her four vouchers for food, but she took some processed food products instead, so&nbsp;that got me&nbsp;suspicious. Some residents told me&nbsp;that there was a&nbsp;child living alone, so&nbsp;I connected the two things and&nbsp;I called the local police and the national police.”</p><p>The boy is&nbsp;now <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>progressing</a> “favorably”, and is&nbsp;known for his “maturity and resilience.”</p><p>And here’s a&nbsp;story that shows how a&nbsp;fatherly love turned an&nbsp;<a href=#>ill orphan</a> into an&nbsp;Olympic champion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWwucRmmKWnnpp6p7vRZmlmsZWWv7R5wGaZqLFdbnqttdWem2aZnKS7pnnFnptmoJmiwKa4xWaYp5xdoLKxwIygpqicXZy%2ForDErGRxaWdog3l7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
