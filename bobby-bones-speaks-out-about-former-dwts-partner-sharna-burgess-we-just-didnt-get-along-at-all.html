Recently, Bones openly shared his honest thoughts on what the experience was like on Burke’s podcast.</p><p>Discussing his partnership with Burgess, Bones said, “She was like a drill sergeant,” often being strict in their choreography. Bones recalled one instance where he strayed from their routine by doing a Floss dance move right after finishing, which apparently angered Burgess.</p><p>“She wanted to kill me. Like, it was real bad,” he said. “There were three or four days at a time where we just did not get along at all.”</p><p>Bones also revealed tensions arose because <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Burgess</a> wanted to control the choreography. He admitted he felt insignificant and worthless at times, emphasizing the intense pressure and emotional toll of the show.</p><p>Bones explained he had to rebuild trust with Burgess and agree not to deviate from the routine without asking first. Despite being the reigning Mirrorball champ at the time, many were shocked when the producers did not invite Burgess back for the following season after her win.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-bobby-bones-wanted-to-host-dwts-gave-harry-jowsey-advice>Bobby Bones Wanted to Host DWTS, Gave Harry Jowsey Advice</h2><p>In another surprising revelation, Bones said, “I thought I was going to be the next host” of DWTS after competing. Bobby Bones expressed his hurt feelings when the announcement of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyra Banks</a> as the host came, despite his openness to co-hosting the show with her.</p><p>He emphasized his deep connection to the show, making it painfully disappointing when the hosting gig went elsewhere. Even now, he still follows the show and its contestants frequently, as he gave some valuable advice and encouragement to Season 32 celebrity Harry Jowsey.</p><p>Much like Bones, Jowsey was not the most talented celebrity dancer, so the two would relate to receiving criticisms from fans and judges of the show.</p><p>“I said to him ‘Hey bro, this isn’t real. It’s so not real that nobody cares.'” Bones said. “And then I had the trophy, and I was like, ‘Look, I’m the worst person ever on this show, and I won the freaking thing.'”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/William-Hung-American-Idol-220x175.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Star William Hung Opens Up About His Gambling Addiction" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57waiZm7Fdl7yvsdJmqqmdkaDAbrvUrWSamp%2BqwW6yzquknqpdmcS1v4ypmKusnpq%2Fbr%2FHmqmnmV2XwrOzxKyqZq%2BVYre2v9Nmm6Kcnql6qLHTZpilp56ceqLAjJqjpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
