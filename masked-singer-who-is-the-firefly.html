And as promised, we truly got the Good, the Bad, and the Cuddly. But the standout performance of the first episode came from the Firefly. Despite a cough attack, she powered through to show off her impressive vocals.</strong></p><p>But who is The Masked Singer Firefly? Let’s take a look at the clues so far and which celebrity is under the mask.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-bba56fdc-1613-4f63-a943-7d4ef6fb3cee>Clues on&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Season 7</h2><p>Firefly started her clues on “The Good Network” TV. She’s seen walking backstage when she gets bumped into and drops papers, including a program for a “Live Comedy” show at the Apollo Theater. She says “nothing is worse than running on empty” with her “buzzzzy” schedule. A framed photo of Tyler Perry is shown.</p><p>She pitches “On The Fly,” which is a charger that works for the Good, the Bad, AND the Cuddly. Men in black wearing a crown, an eye patch, and an astronaut helmet with bunny ears hold up the charger. She says it “keeps her going when [she] fade[s],” as she walks onto a stage with a red curtain. A Statue of Liberty is seen on a stool and a microphone is also on stage.</p><p>Prior to the premiere, we also saw a tiara as a clue for Firefly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p>The Masked Singer Firefly clues from Season 7 Ep. 1</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-aed0ca83-5ae3-4549-9411-272b33f78a6d>Popular Guesses for&nbsp;The Masked Singer&nbsp;Firefly</h2><p>Panelist Ken Jeong predicted The Masked Singer Firefly might be Alicia Keys, but Nick Cannon didn’t seem to agree. Jenny McCarthy went with comedian Aisha Tyler based on all the clues, also noting that it could be Monica.</p><p>A lot of people online agree with Jenny’s guess of Monica. Other popular options were Brandy, Tamar Braxton, Teyana Taylor, and Kelly Rowland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-dbd3758a-2c07-4407-884a-af68d22f49c4>Who is the Firefly on&nbsp;The Masked Singer?</h2><p>Now we knew that Firefly had to be a singer because of all that talent. But there are so many vocalists who could’ve fit in the bill! In the end, thanks to the clues and those runs, we know exactly who this is (in our best Ken impression).</p><p>The Firefly is…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/close-icon.png><p class=has-text-align-center id=block-826093eb-7e1a-4dd7-a946-3dce54548dda><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;SEASON 7 PREMIERE RECAP</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-eb4a6776-9b31-44f2-8abe-d267d1b20c62>Teyana Taylor<strong>!</strong></h2><p>That’s right, it’s the singer, actress, dancer, model, and all-around jill of all trades. Again, the voice helped with this one, but so did the clues. Let’s see how they line up!</p><p>From the beginning, the judges mentioned she has “dancer legs” so that body type makes sense here. We saw a lot of clues pointing to New York, like the Statue of Liberty, and Teyana was born in Harlem. The Apollo Theater on the program points to her appearing on “Showtime at the Apollo” in her hometown of Harlem. The many comedy clues are a reference to the comedy movies she’s been in, including “Madea’s Big Happy Family,” which explains the Tyler Perry clue as well.</p><p>She mentions “fade,” which is an allusion to Kanye West’s “Fade” music video she danced in, as well as her Fade2Fit workout program. The crown/tiara we saw twice in different clues could have a lot of different meanings, either her role in Coming 2 America, her queen status in Doja Cat’s “Woman” music video, or one of her first major public appearances on My Super Sweet 16.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>THE MASKED SINGER&nbsp;CYCLOPS</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>THINGAMABOB</a></strong> | <strong><a href=#>RAM</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/the-voice-janice-freeman-katrina-rose.jpg alt="Kickboxing Instructor Katrina Rose Goes For A Knockout On ‘The Voice’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqqpJ2UYsCqusaeqWavmKR6qr%2BMrZ%2BeZZaev6ayy7Jm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
