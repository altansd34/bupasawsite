In&nbsp;a&nbsp;1992&nbsp;interview, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>admitted</a>, “You go&nbsp;through the motions of&nbsp;feeling&nbsp;it, but you know the studio owns you, the public owns you. So&nbsp;over eight years, you slowly lose your spirit.”</p><p><h2>He&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;switch to&nbsp;another direction of&nbsp;his life.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/289/572/f20c995d40a5cd3211781b351f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;1991, Rourke made a&nbsp;life-changing decision. With the feeling of&nbsp;self-destructing and lacking respect for himself as&nbsp;an&nbsp;actor, he&nbsp;felt compelled to&nbsp;return to&nbsp;boxing, a&nbsp;sport that was one of&nbsp;his first loves earlier in&nbsp;his life. He&nbsp;felt calm, and boxing became a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;protection for him, an&nbsp;escape from the pressures of&nbsp;the acting world.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b9a/7e2/f2407d569d8c3f7f8b7d358ce9.jpg><p>Several years after joining the boxing ring, Mickey faced huge misfortunes that cost him his <a href=# title=career data-link=tag>career</a>. He&nbsp;suffered numerous injuries, such as&nbsp;a&nbsp;split tongue, broken nose, fractured cheekbones, and ribs. He&nbsp;even got warnings of&nbsp;the potential that he&nbsp;might get permanent brain damage if&nbsp;he&nbsp;continued.</p><p>While trying to&nbsp;maintain his acting career simultaneously, fans couldn’t help but notice the changes he&nbsp;was doing to&nbsp;his body. The injuries and the surgeries were evident to&nbsp;all. In&nbsp;certain scenes of&nbsp;“Wild Orchid,” Rourke’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>swollen cheeks</a> were the main reasons that raised suspicions of&nbsp;poorly executed implants. Rourke denied these claims, attributing the swelling to&nbsp;unexpected side effects of&nbsp;tooth surgery, but questions stayed in&nbsp;the air.</p><p><h2>The changes were more than he&nbsp;could ever expect.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/616/125/dc4ae351b3a39913fe737191c9.jpg><p>BIGPICTURESPHOTO.COM / EAST NEWS</p><p>During the 1990s, Rourke’s reputation shifted. He&nbsp;went from a&nbsp;promising young talent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;tragic figure. Because of&nbsp;criticizing the film industry, he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;find work and indulged in&nbsp;extravagant spending.</p><p>“I&nbsp;had my&nbsp;career going, about 10&nbsp;years ago, in&nbsp;the right direction,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>. “I&nbsp;started not liking the business, and not liking myself. I&nbsp;was slowly self-destructing at&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty fast rate. I&nbsp;felt like&nbsp;I didn’t belong doing what&nbsp;I was doing, meaning acting. I&nbsp;felt some sort of&nbsp;guilt about being successful at&nbsp;it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fcd/06f/1abb185711a65e3dc665abce41.jpg><p>AP / East News</p><p>In&nbsp;2009, Rourke <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>revealed</a> that his changing looks resulted from botched facial surgery. He&nbsp;admitted, “Most of&nbsp;it&nbsp;was to&nbsp;correct the damage caused by&nbsp;boxing, but&nbsp;I chose the wrong surgeon to&nbsp;put my&nbsp;face back together.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e23/0e2/ebd7ba5c9895193a4499027ea2.jpg><p>Broadimage / EAST NEWS</p><p>After the success of&nbsp;“The Wrestler” and his Oscar nomination, Mickey Rourke experienced a&nbsp;resurgence in&nbsp;mainstream cinema. However, the challenges didn’t stop there. He&nbsp;expressed disappointment with his role in&nbsp;“Iron Man&nbsp;2,” claiming that much of&nbsp;his performance was left on&nbsp;the cutting room floor and distanced from several projects <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioning</a> that he&nbsp;took them only for financial reasons.</p><p><h2>Learning to&nbsp;love himself again.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b62/624/e9b95e51cc866c31d042ecc107.jpg><p>Kristin Callahan/Everett Collection/East News</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;result, offers for new roles became scarce. Rourke’s physical appearance, including his facial surgery and his rugged, muscular physique, often showcased without a&nbsp;shirt, made it&nbsp;difficult for him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cast in&nbsp;specific roles. His face bore the marks of&nbsp;his previous battles. In&nbsp;2017, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>captioned</a> an&nbsp;Instagram image with the words, “Now I&nbsp;am pretty again. One more to&nbsp;go,” while wearing bandages and pointing out his latest surgical procedure.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/88c/342/bce464578b80dfe643e36eb2bd.jpg><p>Coleman-Rayner / Coleman Rayner / East News</p><p>Mickey Rourke’s journey from a&nbsp;Hollywood heartthrob to&nbsp;a&nbsp;regretful boxer is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cautionary tale about the perils of&nbsp;fame and the consequences of&nbsp;choosing based on&nbsp;personal dissatisfaction. Even though there were many hardships he&nbsp;faced, Rourke’s story reminds&nbsp;us that it&nbsp;is&nbsp;never too late to&nbsp;find redemption and reclaim one’s true purpose.</p><p>Despite all the obstacles and challenges that life has put&nbsp;us through, we&nbsp;must understand that we&nbsp;are worthy and loveable. Most importantly, we&nbsp;are all humans who make <a href=#>mistakes</a> sometimes but can achieve anything we&nbsp;want.</p><p>Preview photo credit imago stock&people / EAST NEWS<span>, </span>AP / East News<span>, </span>Coleman-Rayner / Coleman Rayner / East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK5uwNGanqKbXajBsL7YZpmeoJmjsW65yJyinrFdp7y2vsqeqmabmJa7qLXNoGSfmZOaerW0wK1kp52Rp7m6ecOeqq2qn66ypXnHoqSsnZybenl9knFnbGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
