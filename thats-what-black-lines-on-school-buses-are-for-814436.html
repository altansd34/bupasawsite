They’re actually metal rails put along the sides and the back of&nbsp;the bus to&nbsp;protect its rather thin walls. In&nbsp;case of&nbsp;a&nbsp;collision, they absorb most of&nbsp;its force. It&nbsp;means that the crash doesn’t affect large areas.</p><p>These “rub rails” are also positioned in&nbsp;strategically important spots. The lowest one runs at&nbsp;the floor level. The middle matches the bottom of&nbsp;the seats. And the top one corresponds either to&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the seats or&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the window.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/776/351/17ce375291a6fd34cb8c3310bd.png><p>Your ceiling fan can move in&nbsp;more than one direction for a&nbsp;reason: one is&nbsp;for summer, the other&nbsp;— for winter. When the weather is&nbsp;hot, ceiling fans should move counterclockwise. This makes them pull the warm air up&nbsp;and push the cold air down. And the clockwise&nbsp;— winter&nbsp;— mode moves the warm air down and raises the cool air.</p><p>As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;you notice the blue bristles on&nbsp;your toothbrush start fading, it’s a&nbsp;sure sign that it’s time to&nbsp;replace&nbsp;it.</p><p>You can adjust your stapler so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;staples documents together only temporarily. It’s done by&nbsp;rotating the crimp area. Most staplers have two options for stapling. One is&nbsp;standard. But the other side bends staples away from the center. Later, when you don’t need them anymore, you can easily remove them by&nbsp;hand.</p><p>Lots of&nbsp;people use a&nbsp;knife to&nbsp;remove strawberry stems. But this way, they throw away lots of&nbsp;stuff they could otherwise eat. Instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;knife, use a&nbsp;regular drinking straw. Insert one end of&nbsp;the straw into the bottom of&nbsp;the strawberry and push it&nbsp;gently all the way through. If&nbsp;everything goes as&nbsp;planned, the straw will pop the stem out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/bdb/6e3/d7c7995a26925ffdfe3e1c204c.png><p>A&nbsp;tiny hole in&nbsp;a&nbsp;padlock bottom helps to&nbsp;drain the <a href=# title=water data-link=tag>water</a> from the outdoor lock after the rain. It&nbsp;prevents the thing from rusting and clogging. You can also use this hole to&nbsp;<a href=# title=oil data-link=tag>oil</a> the lock’s hinges so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;doesn’t get stuck. If&nbsp;a&nbsp;lock doesn’t have this small hole, you should only use it&nbsp;inside.</p><p>It’s a&nbsp;bad idea to&nbsp;place dirty dishes covered in&nbsp;mashed potatoes (or&nbsp;any other leftover carbs) closer to&nbsp;the sides of&nbsp;the bottom shelf of&nbsp;your <a href=# title=dishwasher data-link=tag>dishwasher</a>. Several studies have shown that such plates get washed better when you put them in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the rack. So&nbsp;now you know.</p><p>Weird markings on&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;a&nbsp;toothpaste tube have nothing to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the ingredients. They’re actually there for the factory robots. Not so&nbsp;they can brush their own teeth either. Such a&nbsp;colorful square marks the line where the tube has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;cut and folded.</p><p>Most cotton pads have two different textures on&nbsp;each of&nbsp;their sides. One surface is&nbsp;firmer and more absorbent. It’s supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used with nail polish remover. The other side is&nbsp;way finer and softer. You should use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove facial and eye makeup.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/275/2a0/5e8f8f5b0d804ba14b193271a1.png><p>Don’t peel post-it notes off from the bottom. It’ll create a&nbsp;crease in&nbsp;the paper, and the note won’t stick well after that. Tear it&nbsp;off from the side, and it’ll stick for longer!</p><p>While driving when it’s already dark, you might get blinded by&nbsp;the headlights of&nbsp;the <a href=# title=car data-link=tag>car</a> moving behind yours. If&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;manual rearview mirror, find a&nbsp;tab at&nbsp;the bottom and flip&nbsp;it. The mirror has a&nbsp;reflective material behind its glass. By&nbsp;flipping the tab, you change the angle of&nbsp;this material, dimming the lights in&nbsp;the mirror. The whole process is&nbsp;even simpler if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;power mirror. All you need to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;to&nbsp;switch on&nbsp;the nighttime mode.</p><p>Bath foam relieves stress, cleanses the <a href=# title=skin data-link=tag>skin</a>, AND keeps the water warm! Foam is&nbsp;made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;tiny air bubbles. They form an&nbsp;insulating layer on&nbsp;the water surface, keeping the heat from escaping.</p><p>Let’s say, you’re reading a&nbsp;paper book. Then you decide to&nbsp;take a&nbsp;break and realize you don’t have a&nbsp;bookmark. Should you leave a&nbsp;dog ear? You don’t need to&nbsp;— that’s what the dust jacket is&nbsp;for! Apparently, providing you with the information about the book and its author isn’t its only purpose.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1b0/218/0ce369551a90b7cf9991536703.png><p>Your stomach growls, and suddenly, a&nbsp;peanut butter sandwich sounds like a&nbsp;great idea! You open a&nbsp;jar... and see quite a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;oil sitting on&nbsp;the top! Duh, time to&nbsp;train your arm muscles and stir, stir, stir...</p><p>But if&nbsp;you store peanut butter jars upside down, the oil will move to&nbsp;the bottom, and all the solids will be&nbsp;on&nbsp;top!</p><p>The main purpose of&nbsp;the drawer under your <a href=# title=oven data-link=tag>oven</a> isn’t to&nbsp;store all those pots and pans! You’re supposed to&nbsp;use this place to&nbsp;keep your food warm while something else is&nbsp;being prepared in&nbsp;the oven!</p><p>If&nbsp;you don’t have anywhere to&nbsp;put a&nbsp;toothpick after using&nbsp;it, snap off the flat end at&nbsp;the first groove and put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the table. Now, you can balance the used part of&nbsp;your toothpick on&nbsp;the grooved part so&nbsp;that it&nbsp;doesn’t have to&nbsp;touch the table.</p><p>The correct way to&nbsp;break off a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Toblerone chocolate bar is&nbsp;by&nbsp;pushing the pointy side downward. Me? I&nbsp;just bite it&nbsp;off, but then I’m hardly ever accused of&nbsp;being correct.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/fc9/820/3d62f55f94b868a9386902322b.png><p>Most extension cords are known to&nbsp;come undone at&nbsp;even the slightest pull. Loosely tie them together, and they’ll stay connected even if&nbsp;you accidentally pull on&nbsp;them. The knot might get tighter, but nothing will get switched off.</p><p>A&nbsp;little groove on&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;a&nbsp;cup lets cool air get underneath&nbsp;it. It&nbsp;saves glassware from cracking when a&nbsp;scorching beverage heats it&nbsp;up. And when you place cups upside down in&nbsp;the dishwasher, the grooves prevent water from gathering in&nbsp;the cups’ bottoms.</p><p>Nonstick pans have a&nbsp;special coating, which makes them so&nbsp;great. But if&nbsp;you use metal utensils while dealing with such a&nbsp;pan, you’re likely to&nbsp;scratch this coating. And once you do&nbsp;it, your pan is&nbsp;ruined. Food will start to&nbsp;stick to&nbsp;its surface and end up&nbsp;burned or&nbsp;unevenly cooked.</p><p>If&nbsp;you’ve always peeled bananas starting from the stem, try doing it&nbsp;the other way round. Pinch the bottom of&nbsp;the banana and pull. This way, you won’t have to&nbsp;deal with strings and mess. By&nbsp;the way, that’s the approach monkeys use. And you don’t want to&nbsp;argue with monkeys.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f1c/2c3/6980e253faa4bb67e3856dbfdd.png><p>Most caps on&nbsp;small tubes are hollow on&nbsp;top and have a&nbsp;little spike inside. Its purpose is&nbsp;to&nbsp;break the foil sticker sealing the tube. The neck of&nbsp;the tube fits right in&nbsp;this hole, and the spike is&nbsp;designed to&nbsp;break the seal. No&nbsp;need to&nbsp;struggle, trying to&nbsp;tear the tiny foil seal off with your fingers!</p><p>The more detergent you use, the cleaner your clothes are, right? Not exactly. If&nbsp;you add too much detergent, you can spoil your things. This will produce too many suds, and your clothes won’t be&nbsp;rubbing against one another! And that’s exactly what helps them get clean. Excess suds can also keep your washing machine from rinsing properly.</p><p>Book pages are often printed on&nbsp;large sheets of&nbsp;paper rather than on&nbsp;small individual ones. If&nbsp;there isn’t enough content to&nbsp;fill these sheets, there are blank pages left. Publishers often print the word “<strong>Notes</strong>” or&nbsp;leave some other signs on&nbsp;them. This way, readers don’t think it’s a&nbsp;printing mistake.</p><p>The rumble strips on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the road are supposed to&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;sleepy drivers who start to&nbsp;doze off behind the wheel. When your tires drift off onto these strips, the noise and vibration work like an&nbsp;alarm clock!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/75d/610/f8f7b35e8897a695a72e93acfd.png><p>It’s a&nbsp;popular misconception that pumping a&nbsp;mascara wand back and force allows more product to&nbsp;stay on&nbsp;it. In&nbsp;reality, doing this will only spoil your mascara. By&nbsp;moving the wand, you push air inside the tube. This not only produces flakes and clumps but also makes the mascara dry out.</p><p>A&nbsp;dime-sized hole in&nbsp;the elevator doors is&nbsp;a&nbsp;keyhole. If&nbsp;the doors get stuck, an&nbsp;operator can open them manually by&nbsp;inserting a&nbsp;special key in&nbsp;this hole. The same tool is&nbsp;used when an&nbsp;elevator needs routine maintenance.</p><p>The bubbles in&nbsp;your soda push the straw up&nbsp;when they balance the buoyancy with the mass of&nbsp;the straw. But you can keep your straw from rising in&nbsp;your soda can by&nbsp;putting it&nbsp;through the hole in&nbsp;the metal pull ring. Ah, the science behind soda cans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/645/fdf/69c4195d2ea6b25d26d59ede68.png><p>Those squares of&nbsp;fabric that come with clothes are for you to&nbsp;try out your cleaning products on&nbsp;them first. This way, you won’t ruin the entire item once you decide to&nbsp;wash&nbsp;it.</p><p>The soft round part under a&nbsp;soda bottle cap keeps the bubbles from escaping. Without&nbsp;it, your pop would go&nbsp;flat in&nbsp;no&nbsp;time, probably even before you buy&nbsp;it. And what’s worse, if&nbsp;you bought the flat drink for your dad, then your pop’s pop won’t pop.</p><p>The utility knife is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;last way longer than most people think. The knife blade is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;narrow parallel sections. When the instrument gets blunt, break off the top section with the cap you can find at&nbsp;the bottom. Voilà, you have a&nbsp;brand-new sharp blade again! But don’t forget to&nbsp;put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;pair of&nbsp;safety gloves and goggles before doing&nbsp;it! Yes, it’s another sharp tip from <strong>Bright Side</strong>!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGprdOsZLCgkal6o7jAnKJmpJmjsrR5zqdkrJuYpLytecGuqp6rXZa%2FpnnFqKlmcGFpgXSCjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
