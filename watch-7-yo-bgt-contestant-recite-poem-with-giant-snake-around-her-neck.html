Hosts Ant & Dec noticed that Olivia had a wooden box with her backstage but she refused to show them what was inside of it. She made her way onto the stage with excitement. When judge Amanda Holden asked Olivia what she wants to be when she grows up, she confidently said “a zoologist.”</p><p>When it came time for Olivia to perform her act, she ran off backstage leaving the judges confused. She reached into the wooden box and pulled out a huge snake which had Ant & Dec shook. Olivia returned to the stage with the snake around her neck.

They were trying to get all of the judges to say “yes” because Lucy continued to tighten around Olivia’s neck. Finally, all three judges voted her through to the next round. While many were looking forward to seeing what Olivia was going to do next, she did not appear in the Semifinals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-she-now>Where Is She Now?</h3><p>After shocking the world with her poetry skills and pet snake on ‘BGT,’ Olivia’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">love for animals continues.</a> Olivia got to visit Durrell Wildlife park straight after her audition and took a look at all of the animals with conservationist Gerald Durrell.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>She posted a series of poems on YouTube about animals and the preservation of their habitats in 2015.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Olivia performed a poem in memory of Cecil the Lion that has over 21,000 views on YouTube.
