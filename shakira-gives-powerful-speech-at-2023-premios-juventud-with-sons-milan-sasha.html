She perfected her look with her long and shiny blonde hair and a basic glam makeup look.</p><p>As the Colombian superstar received her awards, Milan and Sasha were physically present to witness their mom on stage. The two both sported a sporty terno matched with a pair of Chuck Taylors.</p><p>Overall, Shakira swept eight awards including Girl Power honor, for her song “TQG” with Karol G and Tropical Mix prize for her single “Monotonía” with Ozuna. Furthermore, she snatched the Female Artist award and received two more accolades for her collaboration with Bizarrap “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakira: Bzrp Music Sessions, Vol. 53.</a>”</p><p>On Instagram, the “Beautiful Liar” singer posted a series of snaps during the event. The slideshow consisted of her photos posing with her songs as they hold the trophies and one where they were hugging each other.</p><p>Shakira’s triumphant night out comes after a Spanish court opened a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">second investigation into her taxes</a>. The said tax fraud inquiry adds to the singer’s current tax evasion case against the Spanish government.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-she-delivers-an-emotional-acceptance-speech>She Delivers an Emotional Acceptance Speech</h2><p>On the same night, Shakira also accepted Premios Juventud’s Agent of Change award. The Colombian powerhouse artist then took the opportunity to deliver a sentimental speech.</p><p>“We live in an ambiguous world, surrounded by good music, beauty, TikTok dances, filtered selfies. But there are realities that cannot be filtered or made up,” she said. “There are places where people who are born poor die poor because they do not have the opportunity to receive a quality education.”</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shakira</a> went on to share how her son Milan told her with sadness “that a friend of his would like to change his skin color” for they don’t feel like they belong. According to the singer, it has since become her duty as a mother to show him that “he doesn’t have to be quiet, that he can raise his hand, that he can use his voice and that he can complain about that and everything else he disagrees with.”</p><p>“I want my children to understand that to be an agent of change you don’t have to be a female pop star,” she said. “You don’t have to have a foundation, you don’t have to be a politician or even occupy a place of power, you don’t have to be famous or rich. To be an agent of change you just have to differentiate what is right from what is wrong.”</p><p>The pop star ended her speech by emphasizing the power of the youth to influence others.&nbsp;</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Original_DerekHough_HayleyErbert_Jon-KopaloffWireImage-220x147.jpeg alt="Derek Hough, Hayley Erbert Dance in New Music Video for ‘Turning Page’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qGYpKGilnqotdWeqmaon6yys7LUpWSsqJWasKl5wK1ka2hiaHqxvsSmoKirXZ%2FCt7HNraydZaeewal50qilrGWdnrmiuoysmKygkWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
