In January, he shared that he would not be attending the National Television Awards, <a href=#>saying</a> host David Walliams “makes my skin crawl.”</p><p>The Good Morning Britain host even made sure to take a dig at David in response to reports he was being considered as a guest judge. He denied they had a “rivalry,” which “would imply a modicum of professional respect.” He instead preferred the word “enmity.”</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/X-Factor-Eskimo-Blonde.jpeg alt="Girl Group Refuses To Leave, Begging Judges To Change Vote — Watch What Security Had To Do Next" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qGwZqiZmr%2B0ecyoqaCZnmKworrTZpqopZVir6KvymaYrGWSnMFuttSdnp5llauyr3nIn2ShnV2srq%2FAxJ1kradf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
