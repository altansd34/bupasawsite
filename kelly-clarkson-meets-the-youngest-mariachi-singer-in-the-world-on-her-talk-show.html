For those who may not know, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Clarkson</a> expressed her love of Spanish music during her time on NBC’s The Voice. The producers of The Kelly Clarkson Show were eager to have López on their program, but they had to wait for the end of the Hollywood writers’ strike before they could make it happen.</p><p>When the show resumed in October, they decided to give Adalberto López, López’s father, a call to arrange a Zoom call for a special segment on the show, called What I’m Liking? Clarkson explained that she wanted to celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month, even though it had already concluded by the time the new episodes were airing.</p><p>During their heartwarming interaction, Clarkson asked young López about his passion for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">mariachi</a> music and where it all began. López shared that his journey into the world of mariachi started with his sister Ariella, who learned from his grandfather, Adalberto’s father. López’s talents quickly gained recognition, as he began performing in front of audiences around San Antonio.</p><p>He even appeared on the Mexican version of America’s Got Talent and NBC’s Little Big Shots. Remarkably, López still holds the Guinness World Record for being the youngest mariachi singer, earning this title when he was just four years old.</p><p>Clarkson’s emotional reaction to López’s performance on her show didn’t go unnoticed. Adalberto shared that the renowned singer was so touched that she extended an invitation to Mateo to appear on her show in person in the future.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mateo-lopez-s-2023-xfl-championship-performance-went-viral>Mateo López’s 2023 XFL Championship Performance Went Viral</h2><p>López recently delivered a show-stopping performance at the 2023 XFL Championship Game.
