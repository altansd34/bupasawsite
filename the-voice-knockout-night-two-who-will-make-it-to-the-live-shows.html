It may all come down to these performances, but we predict Kelly Clarkson will stick with <strong>Kenzie Wheeler</strong>, whom she turned for almost immediately in the Blinds — while blocking Blake Shelton.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-rio-doyle-vs-zania-alak-team-legend>3.

Anna sang “If I Die Young” by The Band Perry, while Gihanna performed “Glitter in the Air” by P!nk.</p><p>Both singers are original Team Kelly members who won their Battles. Clarkson told Anna that her performance was “spiritual,” while she said Gihanna had “such a big presence.” We predict that she will choose <strong>Gihanna Zoë</strong> as the winner of this Knockout, but we wouldn’t be surprised if Shelton steals Anna for his team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhQ–DaBrpw</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-will-win-the-voice-four-way-knockout>Who Will Win ‘The Voice’ Four-Way Knockout?</h3><p>The four artists who were saved by their coaches in the Voice Battles will go up against each other in a Four-Way Knockout, to be voted on by the viewers.
