But stories of employee walkouts and discontent may not necessarily paint an accurate picture of how U.S. consumers and Disney fans feel about how the company has handled the situation.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">New Morning Consult survey data indicates the outcry is probably more internal than external, as Disney fans not only generally support the steps taken by the company but also oppose the more drastic proposed measures, such as pulling business from Florida and closing down parks in the state. Still, more Disney fans think it’s important for younger audiences to have access to LGBTQ+ entertainment content than those who do not.</p><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m">More on the numbers</h2><ul class="mb-m ml-m text-body-large"><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Forty-one percent of adults and 44% of Disney fans said it’s important for younger audiences to have access to TV shows and films that discuss LGBTQ+ themes. About one-third of each demographic said younger audiences should not be exposed to these themes.&nbsp;</li><li class="list-disc list-outside mb-s last:mb-0">Sixty-two percent of Disney fans said the entertainment industry supports the LGBTQ+ community through the content it produces, a view initially espoused by Disney when asked to take a stance on the bill. That statement was quickly contradicted by employees of Disney’s Pixar studio who <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>alleged the company self-censored scenes of LGBTQ+ affection</a> in Pixar films, including the removal of a same-gender kiss in the upcoming film, “Lightyear,” though that kiss has since <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>reportedly been restored to the movie</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 class="font-semibold text-headline2 leading-headline2 mb-m">The impact</h2><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Frustration with Disney appears to be largely internal — perhaps amplified by media coverage — as U.S. consumers are, for the most part, satisfied with the actions taken by the company in the wake of Florida’s bill. Facing pressure from employees and allies, Disney brands such as Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN have <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>issued statements condemning anti-LGBTQ+ legislation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In fact, awareness of Disney’s actions is relatively low, even among self-identified fans. Roughly 3 in 5 (62 percent) said they’d heard nothing about Disney’s reported censorship of Pixar movies, while 57 percent said the same of Chapek’s eventual denouncement of the bill.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">But what happens when other centers of the entertainment industry are caught in similar controversy? Georgia, a Hollywood production hub in recent years, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>has introduced its own version of the anti-LGBTQ+ legislation</a>, and Texas is currently attempting to classify <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>gender-affirming care for children as child abuse</a>. As audiences become more aware of these pieces of legislation, consumer sentiment could shift, and Hollywood studios may need to prepare to do a lot more than make some donations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Disney did not respond to request for comment for this story.&nbsp;</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large"><a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#><i>Survey</i></a><i> conducted March 14-17, 2022, among a representative sample of 2,210 U.S. adults, with an unweighted margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZLavv9Oapa1lmaPBpriOnaCsppWueq2zwa2oZp6cpL%2BqsMBmmaKknA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
