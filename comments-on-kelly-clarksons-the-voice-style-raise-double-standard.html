Fans on social media criticized the pink dress worn during <a href=#>Monday night’s Live Playoffs</a>, with some telling her to fire her stylist.</strong></p><p>What makes these comments especially frustrating is that Clarkson’s male co-stars don’t receive the same level of scrutiny over their appearance. It shows a double standard in how the public responds to men and women in the spotlight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kelly, you must change to another stylist! That froufrou frothy dress is cute,<br>but a harsh red leather belt?? Your outfits have such a range from dull to sexy. It really distracts from your image!

Viewers were quick to share their thoughts about the look on social media, telling the star she should hire a new stylist. Some of them mentioned that they disliked other outfits she’s been wearing lately.</p><p>“Your outfits have such a range from dull to sexy,” wrote one user. “It really distracts from your image! Great that your personality usually overcomes it, but not tonight!”</p><p>Another fan wrote that they were “begging for you to change your look,” calling Monday’s outfit “the ugliest dress ever.” Someone else tweeted that Clarkson is “wearing frumpier outfits every time I see her.” Another viewer called the pink dress “very unflattering.”</p><p>This is just a sample of the negative reaction Clarkson’s dress received this week. Scroll through Twitter, and the criticism just <a href=#>keeps on coming</a>. However, it’s much harder to find similar responses to the outfits worn by Clarkson’s male co-stars.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>KELLY CLARKSON SAYS SHE WAS ‘MISERABLE’ STAYING SKINNY AFTER ‘IDOL’ WIN</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can someone explain to me what’s happening to Kelly Clarkson?

The lack of criticism for Shelton’s style is particularly interesting, considering he’s frequently dressed down compared to the other coaches.</p><p>Shelton usually rocks simple jeans and cowboy boots on the show. The most formal he typically gets is putting a blazer on over the casual attire. If Clarkson were to show up to the live shows wearing a casual outfit like that, she’d probably receive just as much (if not more) negative feedback as she does now.</p><p>Why is Clarkson expected to dress up (with elaborate hair and makeup to boot) and get roasted for her style? Meanwhile Shelton can regularly wear the same variation on denim and flannel with almost no criticism. Forget the outfits; that double standard is the worst look of all.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>KELLY CLARKSON THROWS STUFF AT ‘THE VOICE’ CONTESTANT AFTER EPIC PERFORMANCE</a></strong></p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Amy-Mottram-Audition-X-Factor-UK.png alt="Watch the ‘X Factor’ Audition that Makes the Judges Emotional" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wqikpp2eqcBuu81mop6knK56pLjAq6Ksp56oerW0xGatqKGTmnq0wNilnGaqkZ7ApnnDqKybpJViwLWtzZ2Yq5xf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
