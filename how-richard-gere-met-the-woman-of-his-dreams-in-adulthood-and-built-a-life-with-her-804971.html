However, several years had to&nbsp;pass before they could feel an&nbsp;attraction to&nbsp;each other and start a&nbsp;romantic relationship.</p><p>The 2&nbsp;began dating in&nbsp;2014, but it&nbsp;was in&nbsp;2018 that they decided to&nbsp;get married in&nbsp;a&nbsp;discreet wedding. The actor found in&nbsp;his wife a&nbsp;partner who values humanitarian work, as&nbsp;Silva works in&nbsp;a&nbsp;foundation that fights to&nbsp;eradicate homelessness in&nbsp;Spain.</p><p>He&nbsp;has also <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that: “I&nbsp;am the happiest man in&nbsp;the universe&nbsp;— how could&nbsp;I not&nbsp;be? I’m married to&nbsp;a&nbsp;beautiful woman who is&nbsp;smart, sensitive, committed to&nbsp;helping people, who’s fun, patient, who knows how to&nbsp;forgive, who’s a&nbsp;great cook&nbsp;— and who makes the best salads in&nbsp;the world!”</p><p>The young activist <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, in&nbsp;turn, “I&nbsp;feel like I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;a&nbsp;true fairytale. Without a&nbsp;doubt, I&nbsp;feel like the luckiest woman in&nbsp;the world... What could be&nbsp;more romantic than a&nbsp;man who writes you songs every day?” And the fact is&nbsp;that Gere, staying at&nbsp;the family hotel, courted her by&nbsp;sending her flowers until she agreed to&nbsp;go&nbsp;out with him, and when they got married, he&nbsp;began to&nbsp;sing to&nbsp;her every day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/34e/9fc/5f5eff5ef6bca0fd5530404455.jpg><p>In&nbsp;addition, Silva has nothing but praise for her husband: “He&nbsp;is&nbsp;the most humble, sensitive, affectionate, attentive, funny, generous man that I’ve ever met. What can I&nbsp;say? I’m so&nbsp;in&nbsp;love! How would you feel if&nbsp;each morning you were asked, ’What would make you happy today?’ Not a&nbsp;day goes by&nbsp;that he&nbsp;doesn’t mention how important I&nbsp;am to&nbsp;him. I&nbsp;feel very lucky.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/171/fdb/d33b985ee9897f21d66bc14f72.jpg><p>Both were going through the divorce process when they met again after a&nbsp;long time. And despite being more than 30&nbsp;years apart, that was no&nbsp;impediment to&nbsp;the love and support they have for each other in&nbsp;overcoming their difficulties.</p><p>On&nbsp;this topic, Silva said, “Love stories with a&nbsp;complicated beginning, where you have to&nbsp;overcome difficulties together, can bring you closer... I’m sure&nbsp;I did have some doubts at&nbsp;some point. In&nbsp;the beginning, he&nbsp;was more convinced than&nbsp;me. But from very early&nbsp;on, we&nbsp;felt that we&nbsp;were destined to&nbsp;be&nbsp;together.”</p><p>In&nbsp;2019 they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>welcomed</a> a&nbsp;baby boy into the world whom they named Alexander. While they both already have their respective children from their previous <a href=# title=marriages data-link=tag>marriages</a>, this was the first one they welcomed together. And in&nbsp;2020, they announced the birth of&nbsp;their second baby. They currently live together on&nbsp;a&nbsp;ranch in&nbsp;New York, where they spend time together in&nbsp;complete privacy.</p><p>While he&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;mature age, Richard Gere proved that love can knock on&nbsp;your door at&nbsp;any time in&nbsp;life. And by&nbsp;finding his ideal partner in&nbsp;Alejandra Silva, he&nbsp;managed to&nbsp;show a&nbsp;loving and caring side of&nbsp;him, where the obstacles they faced in&nbsp;the past were easier to&nbsp;overcome as&nbsp;they showed their affection for each other every minute of&nbsp;the day.</p><p>What do&nbsp;you think is&nbsp;the most important thing to&nbsp;find in&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner? What qualities do&nbsp;you value in&nbsp;the person you have chosen as&nbsp;your life partner?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLWww4yroJygkaexbrPEq5xmpZWperW0xGauqKWRo3qwsoyhoKxllKeyornSZqCnZZGZwq3Ax6imnWWRo7FurtSio61lkWK5qrLEZq6irJhitaa%2BjHFnbXFnZnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
