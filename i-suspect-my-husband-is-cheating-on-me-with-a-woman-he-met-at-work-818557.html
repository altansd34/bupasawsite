He&nbsp;does maintenance work and has been <strong>spending a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time helping a&nbsp;single mom</strong> lately, which I’m okay with because he’s always been kind and helpful. They’ve been texting each other late at&nbsp;night, but it’s mostly about friendly stuff.</p><p>Things started bothering me&nbsp;when&nbsp;I saw a&nbsp;text from her saying she was scared her ex&nbsp;might come around or&nbsp;something, and <strong>my&nbsp;husband wanted to&nbsp;go&nbsp;over to&nbsp;her house</strong> to&nbsp;watch over her. We&nbsp;had a&nbsp;big fight about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Then, the other day, <strong>he&nbsp;picked her and her kids up&nbsp;from work and school without telling&nbsp;me</strong>. Lately, he’s been „forgetting“ tools at&nbsp;her house, and&nbsp;I can’t shake the feeling that something might be&nbsp;going on&nbsp;between them.»</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/39c/52f/6bfc3e5bab9a899cbce5403cca.jpg><p>«I’m feeling so&nbsp;frustrated right now. Whenever I&nbsp;bring up&nbsp;my&nbsp;concerns about my&nbsp;husband helping this single mom, he&nbsp;gets really angry. But it’s getting worse. The other day, <strong>he&nbsp;even asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;babysit her kids while she went to&nbsp;work</strong>, and&nbsp;I said no&nbsp;way. I&nbsp;just don’t want anything to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with her, and I’m tired of&nbsp;hearing about her. My&nbsp;husband blew up&nbsp;at&nbsp;me&nbsp;for refusing and said that&nbsp;I was trying to&nbsp;stop him from being a&nbsp;good person.</p><p>I’m stuck and don’t know what to&nbsp;do. Should I&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;this woman and ask her to&nbsp;stop messaging him so&nbsp;late? I’m starting to&nbsp;feel uncomfortable with the idea of&nbsp;them just being friends. But it’s complicated because <strong>we&nbsp;have kids together, so&nbsp;leaving him isn’t an&nbsp;easy option</strong>. I&nbsp;feel lost and can’t think clearly with all these emotions swirling around. Any advice would be&nbsp;appreciated.»</p><p><h2>Many readers chimed in&nbsp;after seeing her post, sharing their perspectives and giving suggestions.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2be/2d4/beeceb5efea87c41f65fc544a4.png><p>You could trust your husband, but I would never trust a single woman with kids on a manhunt for a stepfather. I would put myself in a situation where we're all three in the same room, and watch their interactions. If you find he is cheating..Dump him, take half of everything he has and move on..</p><ul><li>He&nbsp;may have a&nbsp;kind heart for her, but he&nbsp;doesn’t care about your feelings. You said you understand that he&nbsp;likes to&nbsp;help people, but he&nbsp;needs some boundaries as&nbsp;this is&nbsp;affecting your relationship and trust for him. How would he&nbsp;feel if&nbsp;the situation were reversed? If&nbsp;he’s not willing to&nbsp;put your needs first, then&nbsp;I think you do&nbsp;need to&nbsp;reconsider your relationship with him.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Dear_Parsnip_6802&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Emotional affairs are sneaky. Good people slip into them all the time. They lie to&nbsp;themselves and tell themselves they aren’t doing anything technically wrong. They don’t want to&nbsp;examine where the good feelings are coming from, they just want them to&nbsp;keep coming. Pushing them to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;what they’re doing may be&nbsp;the wake-up call that they don’t want, but they need.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;bamatrek&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>Honestly, any husband who is&nbsp;truly innocent and cares about his wife would make it&nbsp;a&nbsp;point to&nbsp;make sure that the two women were friendly, and his wife was comfortable. And any decent single mom would invite the woman over and maintain appropriate levels of&nbsp;contact. Don’t let your husband gaslight and <a href=# title=manipulate data-link=tag>manipulate</a> you into thinking you are crazy.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Daydream-amnesia&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/738/ffd/be380252e3842452aa90f20158.png><ul><li>It&nbsp;sounds like you’ve got a&nbsp;knight in&nbsp;shining armor. They will also go&nbsp;after the nearest damsel in&nbsp;distress. If&nbsp;you point out a&nbsp;problem, you will turn into the evil queen who is&nbsp;out to&nbsp;get the poor damsel and block the shining knight.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Fine-Beautiful5863&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><ul><li>I&nbsp;would sit him down and tell him point-blank, «It’s her or&nbsp;me!

She’s openly inserted him into the «substitute husband» role, and he’s happy to&nbsp;take it&nbsp;on. That’s a&nbsp;problem on&nbsp;its own. Nobody should get priority over your life partner whom you made vows.
