The Mayyas</h2><p>In Season 17, this hypnotizing act from Lebanon became the first dance group to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">win a traditional season of AGT</a>. They earned judge Sofia Vergara’s Golden Buzzer with their audition and went on to receive enough votes from America to achieve the $1 million prize. It’s not their first Got Talent win, as they previously earned first place on Arabs Got Talent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-v-unbeatable>2. V. Unbeatable</h2><p>This acrobatic dance group from India blew the judges away with their high-flying act on Season 14 of AGT. It seemed possible that the group would win the show, but <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>fans were shocked</a> when they only made it to fourth place. They later returned for AGT: The Champions and were chosen as the winners.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-light-balance>3.

Zurcaroh</h2><p>This acrobatic dance group was the runner-up in Season 13 of AGT, losing to Shin Lim. The group is based in Austria, with a Brazilian choreographer named Peterson da Cruz Hora. Tyra Banks pressed the Golden Buzzer for the group, who combined dance with gymnastics and acrobatics.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-urbancrew>5. Urbancrew</h2><p>In Season 17, this group from the Philippines made it to the Semifinals with their energetic act, having previously competed on both Asia’s Got Talent and Pilipinas Got Talent. Their acrobatic routines were perfectly in sync, wowing the judges.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg4t3iVMtxg</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-6-w-a-f-f-l-e-crew>6. W.A.F.F.L.E. Crew</h2><p>This group from New York City (whose name stands for “We Are Family for Life Entertainment”) earned the Golden Buzzer from judge Simon Cowell in Season 15. They brought amazing energy to the stage with every performance, taking them to the Semifinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1Vs5dR52cw</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-7-junior-new-system>7. Junior New System</h2><p>In Season 13, this group from the Philippines wowed the judges with their acrobatic moves, and then they shocked them by dancing and even doing flips in high heels. The group was impressive enough to make it to the Semifinals. They later competed on World’s Got Talent.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-8-diavolo>8. Diavolo</h2><p>This acrobatic dance group from Season 12 did some amazing things on the AGT stage. The group mixes movement with architectural structures, as directed by Jacques Heim. Their audition involved dancing on top of and around a rocking structure that looked as if it might crush them.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agKoMdnyNtk</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-9-chapkidz>9. Chapkidz</h2><p>In Season 16, this dance act consisting of performers aged 12 to 18 impressed the judges with their audition. They were a younger version of previous act Chapkis Dance Family. The group’s synchronized moves sent them all the way to the Semifinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-10-fusion-japan>10. Fusion Japan</h2><p>This Season 17 dance group from Japan was made up of two rival groups who decided to combine their talents and compete on AGT. Their audition featured some amazing acrobatics that impressed the judges. They made it to the Semifinals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-11-light-balance-kids>11. Light Balance Kids</h2><p>V. Unbeatable wasn’t the only dance group in the Season 14 Finals. This Ukrainian act featured young dancers in light-up clothing. They were mentored by previous act Light Balance. Light Balance Kids earned the Golden Buzzer from guest judge Ellie Kemper during the Judge Cuts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-12-just-jerk>12. Just Jerk</h2><p>This Korean dance group showed off some seriously cool moves in Season 12 of the show. Their audition impressed the judges, and they made it to the Quarterfinals. After AGT, they ended up performing at the Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb_Oq6iAjf4</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Honorable Mentions</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-13-fighting-gravity>13. Fighting Gravity</h2><p>This blacklight dance group featured brothers from Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity at Virginia Tech. They finished Season 5 in third place. The group used blacklight technology to make it look as if they were, well, “fighting gravity,” floating and flying through the air.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-14-the-untouchables>14. The Untouchables</h2><p>This dance group from Season 7 was coached by members of the Miami All Stars, who reached the finals of Season 6. The oldest member of the group was just 13 years old. They lit up the stage with colorful outfits and infectious dance moves, making it to sixth place.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-15-team-iluminate>15. Team iLuminate</h2><p>This light-up dance group finished in third place in Season 6 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AGT</a>. The group was created by Miral Kotb, who studied both computer science and dance. Much like Light Balance, the group performed in the dark while wearing light-up costumes and showing off improbable moves.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-16-innovative-force>16.

Their incredible talent took them all the way to the Finals.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vETHFfgWWj4</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-17-fab-five>17. Fab Five</h2><p>These five sisters grew up on a dairy farm in Utah. They brought their clogging act to Season 4 of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">America’s Got Talent</a>, and made it to the finals. The women wore themed outfits and danced to pop music during their performances. Have you been watching long enough to remember them?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Did we miss your favorite?
