Meet Jesús Aceves, a 55-year-old man born with a condition called hypertrichosis, which means he has abnormal hair growth over his body, especially his face. Although married with kids, Jesús isn’t fully happy with his living conditions. He says he and his family suffer discrimination."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But now, he’s tired of&nbsp;being seen as&nbsp;a&nbsp;freak. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;consequence of&nbsp;years on&nbsp;the road, he’s been known as&nbsp;The Wolf Man.</p><p>Back home and not in&nbsp;the circus anymore, he’s facing another challenge: finding a&nbsp;“normal” job. He&nbsp;needs to&nbsp;support his family since his wife works in&nbsp;temporary jobs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2bc/17c/b583525f26bc3527c4c5425569.png><p>After several failed job interviews, he&nbsp;agreed to&nbsp;try something he&nbsp;had always avoided: shave his face. He&nbsp;relied on&nbsp;his family barber to&nbsp;transform him, even creating eyebrows and lashes.</p><p>The experience was difficult since the face is&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely sensitive body area, but both he&nbsp;and his wife believed that simply by&nbsp;shaving, he&nbsp;would be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;job.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/56a/def/03cff9505d88b1f33b0c07085b.png><p>Jesús did several interviews, and it’s confident that now he’ll find somewhere to&nbsp;work besides the circus. If&nbsp;this happens, he&nbsp;must shave his face every 2&nbsp;days.</p><p>Although rare, some conditions aren’t impossible to&nbsp;have. Luckily, people find a&nbsp;way to&nbsp;overcome the difficulties a&nbsp;rare condition brings and strive in&nbsp;life. Hannah Tyre, for example, was born with osteogenesis imperfecta, meaning that her bones break very easily. But her love for <a href=# title=makeup data-link=tag>makeup</a> made her an&nbsp;<a href=#>internet influencer</a>, reaching millions of&nbsp;followers. We&nbsp;hope that, by&nbsp;reaching the mainstream media, people with genetic diseases won’t suffer more discrimination.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZL2mu8%2BlnGannqHGbrfNqK5mpZVirrR5wGadq52RoHq1tMRmrqiklmK6orqMrKurrZecuaa%2FjK2mZp6Zo7FurYyjpptln6rBtLXDnmStoJVisKq%2Bwq6qZnBhan52fI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
