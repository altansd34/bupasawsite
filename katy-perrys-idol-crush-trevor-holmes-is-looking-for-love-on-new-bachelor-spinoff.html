That’s because Katy Perry had a massive crush on him when he auditioned on season 16. Now Trevor is looking for love on ABC’S new show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelor Presents: Listen To Your Heart.</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-katy-perry-thought-trevor-holmes-was-so-hot>Katy Perry Thought Trevor Holmes Was “So Hot”</h2><p>When he stepped into the judging room for his American Idol audition, Katy immediately said Trevor was “so hot.” Trevor said that he had a crush on Katy. It seemed like they were both into each other. There was only one problem, he had a girlfriend, Sierra, at the time. It became a “love triangle” as he called it with the three of them. Katy jokingly cried over Trevor’s performance during Hollywood week and even had a hilarious staredown with Trevor’s girlfriend. How awkward!</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Ultimately, Trevor did not make it through to the live shows and was sent packing. Katy is ironically the one that delivered the news to him. She felt like he was missing the sparkle during his performances, the same sparkle that she saw in his eyes. “I got to sing in front of the world and it was amazing exposure so I literally have nothing bad to say about it,” he said in a TMZ interview speaking about his time on ‘Idol.’ Trevor said he was also thankful for Katy because she launched him into the public eye. There are clearly no hard feelings here between the two musical talents.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED:</strong> <strong><a href=#>BACHELOR: LISTEN TO YOUR HEART — WHO WILL SHE GET A ROSE FROM JAMIE?

Now he is headed to the infamous Bachelor mansion to showcase his musical talents and maybe even find love.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>RELATED: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>7 TIMES KATY PERRY GOT HER FLIRT ON WITH ‘AMERICAN IDOL’ CONTESTANTS</a></strong></p><p>In The Bachelor Presents: Listen To Your Heart promo, we can see Trevor ready to take on this new show. He announces that he has never dated another musician. This should be interesting! We can also see Trevor may have found love because there is a short clip of him on a date with one of the girls and he even kisses her. There are 23 single girls and guys entering the mansion to not only find love but to go on musical journeys together. They will perform together each week and be judged by some franchise favorites as well as famous musicians. In the end, one couple will be crowned the winners after showing their love and devotion to each other through music.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>“It’s like the real life A Star Is Born,” says Trevor in the promo. This is referencing the 2018 remake of the iconic musical love story. If the show is anything like the movie, we absolutely cannot wait to watch.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-trevor-may-have-found-himself-in-another-love-triangle>Trevor May Have Found Himself In Another Love Triangle</h3><p>In the trailer for this new show, Trevor is questioned by a woman who is asking whether or not he cheated on her. He admits that there has been some emotional cheating. This seems to lead to a lot of tears and drama with Trevor at the center of it all. And while Trevor is finding himself as the source of some relationship drama, Katy is now happily engaged to actor Orlando Bloom. They are expecting a baby girl due early this summer. Things have certainly come full circle!</p><p>Trevor posted the following Instagram post. He hopes that the show will “give some temporary emotional relief” with everything going on in the world in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. He called the show a “new chapter.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-5LimsBpV5/</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# class=broken_link>WHAT IS HOLDING KATY PERRY BACK FROM WALKING DOWN THE AISLE WITH ORLANDO BLOOM?</a></strong></p><p>The Bachelor Presents: Listen To Your Heart premieres tonight on ABC and promises tons of drama along with some extra special celebrity guest judges like Rita Wilson and Jason Mraz.
